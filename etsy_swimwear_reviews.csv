0,I love my suit! It’s great material and the seller was very responsive in changing the text and style for us to match the bride suit :) thank you!
1,"I love it! We bought the bride one and 6 more for our bride squad. The seller was very responsive, shipping was fast and the bathing suits are great quality! I would recommend sizing up one. Definitely buying from this seller again :)"
2,Cute but very see through/ thin material!
3,"It's cute! 👍 I just hope the crotch and nips are not see through when it gets wet......, 😳🤞😳🤞😳🤞 othwrwise👎"
4,It it so pretty
5,"Love it! Size up, it’ll be more comfortable."
6,"Design was as pictured - get decal 
Fast shipping also"
7,Love it! Fast shipping and great material!
8,Perfect! Arrived quickly even with COVID-19
9,Customs suit was requested. Seller made upon request.
10,Ordered a size too small but was provided a refund :)
11,Too small but provided a refund and was very nice.
12,Super cute and the seller was very reliable and always responded to me. So many people complemented me on this American flag bathing suit top. 👍🏼👍🏼 Make sure you lace the back properly and tie the strings super tight. It looks best from the front if it's tied pretty tight. Great buy!
13,"This item is super cute! I wore it for a Memorial Day Bar Crawl and I like that the top was adjustable, supportive and lined well. I would say the colors aren't quite as vibrant as in the picture but it's close. 

As for the seller, she was super responsive, shipping came quicker than estimated and I highly recommend!"
14,Loved my top. Wish I would have got a bigger size but I made it work. Material is great quality! You will love it :)
15,Item is great! Fits a little loose around the bottom so order small. Also material when stretches also stretches the color thin but over all I love it!
16,shipped it across the world surprisingly fast and at a low shipping rate. my top fit perfectly and is extremely cute!
17,love this. I was skeptical about it when I saw it on the manikin but it looks amazing on
18,So cute! Absolutely love this suit
19,This top is SOOOOOOOO cute! I have a small b cup and gives me GREAT cleavage!
20,Absolutely love this bathing suit! Will be great for the 4th
21,Wow!!  Amazing suit!!!  My bf highly recommends it!!
22,Love it! Fits great and the shipping was quick! Thank you :)
23,I love this item! Got it within a week of ordering it! So silky and smooth!
24,Perfect for the 4th of July! Shipped super fast. Great quality.
25,The top is SO comfortable and fits extremely well! Thank you!
26,Love the top! Shipping took a while to get to the States.
27,Colors are slightly washed out as the material is thin. Other than that I love the fit and design!
28,"Super cute, comfortable and well made!"
29,Product was great other than my flag is backwards ?? the stripes are on the left side instead of the right.
30,"When I received this bathing suit, the white areas had a hint of red as if the colors had bleed and the bottoms looked like a 5 year old had stitched them together. Not impressed for $80."
31,Love this classic beach bottom. I originally purchased from i believe their only real etsy competitor HanuHawaii which i took with me on my honey moon. NiuKini quality is definitely superior. HanuHawaii used a tan thread for stitching on their bottoms which looked like my skin was showing through. And after a week of honeymoon diving Hanu stitching started to untie. I love that they both use scraps for the crotch lining but overall for basic black bikini bottom NiuKini quality is perfect and so comfortable. Also super flattering because no where pinches in the skin leaving everything smooth. Thanks Niukini <3
32,Absolutely LOVE! They fit perfectly. I got a size M and I'm 5'9 and 135 pounds just for reference. Highly recommend these bottoms!
33,"I absolutely love this suit! It is so comfortable and flattering, and arrived quickly. I usually wear M in bottoms but I am really glad I ordered the XS, they fit perfectly and don't pinch at all. For reference, I am 5'6, 130 lb. with 38-39 in. hips."
34,"Love these!! I own the regular Maile cut and then asked Annie if she could adjust the back to have more moderate coverage. Both styles are perfect for me. They are easily the comfiest bikini bottoms I have ever owned—no pinching or cutting into skin. They feel like a second skin. Thanks, Annie!"
35,"I'm similar built to the model in the picture, the measurements were right but it's just not my go to bikini! It doesn't look as good on me but the quality is great and the color was exactly what I expected :)"
36,"This is my new favorite swimsuit! Annie was accommodating to my time frame and had my suit out quickly. The seamless bottom is PERFECT! It doesn’t cut into my sides like most other suits do. I’m 5’8 @ 140lbs and the medium bottom and top both fit very well.  Will be ordering again soon. Thanks so much, Annie."
37,"I love the shape of this bottom, the only thing I would recommend is to get one size down, since is seamless  stretches little bit! Other than that I’m happy!"
38,"Love my bathing suit top and bottom! I love that the bottoms are seamless, comfortable, and trendy. They look great on. Additionally, the shop owner Annie is personable and easy to work with! I will buy more products from her in the future!"
39,"I love these bottoms so much!!!!! The maker is so sweet and responded to my email asap, and shipped on time! They are so soft and well made and seamless!"
40,"So in love with these bottoms!! I love the design and that they are seamless, I haven't had the rolling problem as others have had"
41,So cute! Love the fit and the fabric. My bum is loving the sun!!!
42,Perfect 👌
43,"The quality seems good. Unlined, just a single layer of fabric. There is a white liner in the crotch area that shows a little bit when wearing it, however. Note that the cut is a V shape in front and back (the pictures don’t show it). Not exactly what I thought I was getting but it is very comfortable !"
44,"Well made, color is perfect as pictured. Very flattering. I hope to eventually get a matching top. Coverage is as described. Sizing was perfect."
45,"AMAZING. just buy. not only great quality, but the shop owner is easy to communitcate with and is willing to work with special requests. I am so happy with my order!"
46,"Super comfy, I got the black bottoms and it fit perfectly in medium."
47,Great fit!
48,Ordered both the Maile and Napali bottoms and both were perfect! Comfortable and flattering fit. Annie (the seller) was extremely accommodating  and made sure they would arrive in time for my vacation. I'll definitely be ordering more colors for my next trip!
49,"The bottoms are perfect! I have been searching forever to find this thin/super soft material for a bathing suit. The seller responded promptly and was able to accommodate all of my requests. I found a color pattern that I preferred, and the seller made sure to meet all of my requests. Highly recommend this product, and I will be purchasing a bunch more in the future."
50,This bottom fits perfectly and looks great!
51,"I love these bottoms. The fabric and construction are good quality. I was looking for bottoms that wouldn't give me ""muffin top"" and these are perfect. Flattering and the fit is great. I read the sizing description and reviews and ordered according to that and it worked out perfectly. I already want it in more colors ☺ It also shipped a few days before the expected date and got to me quickly. Thanks so much for this cute quality suit!"
52,"I bought these for my fiancé and she loves the look and feel as do I. She hasn't tried them out in the water yet so we don't have a review on how well they hold up to the beach, but the look is really sexy."
53,"Love these! Uber comfy, flattering, and perfect sizing — I usually where a small in bikini bottoms (size 4 in pants) so sizing down to an XS was a good idea."
54,Loved this item; it fits perfectly! Def ordering more!
55,"I love these bottoms! Fit great, and so comfortable!"
56,My bottoms were absolutely worth the wait! They're super cute & comfortable. Unfortunately it's not as tight as I would like but that's because I ordered a M/L since I usually take a medium.
57,Love the way it fits all around
58,Love this suit! I have a very small bust and this suit fits me well. I’m 5’8” and 125 lbs and ordered a small for both top and bottom. It’s so comfy and I love that you could choose your coverage on the bottoms. Will be ordering another!
59,It was a little big. Should have gone down a size. You can see the liner sometimes.
60,SO comfortable! I want all my swim bottoms to be like this!
61,I love this bottom. The size is perfect and  it fits great.
62,Love the bottoms! Great fabric and color. Thank you!!!
63,So cute!!!
64,Love them. Very flattering. Little thinner than I imagined buy perfect nonetheless.
65,"This fits beautifully. My only complaint is that, because it is seamless, the edges rolled (I haven't tried it in water yet, so hopefully it won't slip off). Otherwise, the material is wonderful. I will definitely be ordering more -but perhaps one with seams!"
66,"It has taken a bit for my review, because I had hopes that I would change my mind. The bikini bottom is to big for me however, based on the chart a medium would have been to small. The back doesn't really cover top of my crack. I feel I paid for a very expensive pair of underwear, that are just not that great. 

9/1/2021 I am editing my review, because of the wonderful customer service I received from Annie. I was well over the seven day window for an exchange, and was frustrated with the fit of the Maile bottoms (I am Med/large) Annie reached out and suggested the Ohelo bottoms, as the material was a bit thicker. I received them yesterday and the fit beautifully! Annie went above and beyond to make this order right. You don't find this kind of customer service really anymore. I will be buying more soon. Now a loyal customer."
67,"I love this bottom, it's so comfy, but unfortunately it's a bit too big on me. I'm a 0 by nature, and my butt isn't the largest, so once my bottoms get wet, they kind of want to fall off. Other than that, they look great and couldn't be more comfortable!"
68,In love with these bottoms!!! SO comfortable and cute!! I’m never going back to regular bikini bottoms!🤩
69,"I can't wait to wear these once it warms up! They fit super well, and the fabric is very soft."
70,Love the bottom! Very comfortable and perfect fit!
71,Super cute but the xs fits more like a s/m
72,"Best swim bottoms I have ever put on my body. Butter fabric, hugs all the right places, no digging. So damn comfy too. Going to order more colors ASAP! The shop owner is delightful as well :) thanks !!"
73,Loooove this print! The bottoms are so soft and comfortable! Can’t wait to wear this summer!
74,the best bikini bottoms ever!!
75,Got it and love it!
76,Love this bikini bottom! Super comfy and cute.
77,Super cute! And comfy!
78,Great seller! Easy to work with and wonderful swimsuits.
79,Very comfortable and fits as it should
80,Hands down best bikini bottoms I own!!!
81,These bottoms are super soft and comfortable. They are a lot like the seamless yoga underwear one might find as well but still great for comfy and causal water activities
82,"Love this product, great quality!"
83,Great quality material! Fits true to size.
84,"Awesome fit, cute color! Beware tho these cause major front wedgie! (TMI, sorry)"
85,Excellent communication and products! Shipping was also faster than expected. Thank you for everything!
86,Super comfortable and makes the booty pop!🍑⚡️
87,"I can't speak to the bikini bottoms as they were lost in the mail, but NuiKini went above and beyond in the customer service department.  They refunded my purchase and offered me a discount should I want to purchase another.  (Which I promptly did!)"
88,"Poor quality material. Wouldn't pass as a bikini bottom, would be better suited as silk underwear. Disappointed with material and overall quality for being ""handmade""."
89,"Looks exactly like the photos and the fit is perfect! I'm curvy and 5'3"" so I was a little concerned about the length of the straps but the top does fit properly. I haven't tried it in the water yet but I don't think there would be any issues with transparency as the fabric is thick and solid. Very happy overall and looking forward to trying it out!"
90,"Pattern is even more beautiful in person! Wonderful shop, designer, and product."
91,"i loved this swimwear, the color, fit and material was very nice and complimented me. The packaging and personal note was a very nice touch."
92,"Le maillot de bain est en France!
Il est trés beau.
Merci pour cette transaction ou tout s'est bien passé.
Boutique à l'ecoute, réponse et envoi rapide."
93,"Sarah is amazing!!! I bought blue, white, and black long cover ups and they all came quickly. They look gorgeous on, for any body type, and are the perfect amount of sheer to feel sensual, fabulous for self yet not ""out there"" attracting unwanted gazes. Her customer service, perfection on replying super promptly, and passion for this work shows in each lovely wrapped item. Thank you so much!!! So amazing will be using this for a professional video shoot for upcoming project."
94,"The photos truly don’t do this item justice. I put it on and fell in love. It’s slightly longer than I realized it would be, but it’s going to be absolutely perfect."
95,"Ran to my mailbox, tackled the mailman, ripped open the package. Tried the coverup on and OMG its beautiful! Flows like water when you walk in it, and fits like a dream. Very good construction, and fit. Also its shipped super fast! Sarah was so professional and kind, she even sent me a thank you note! I will be ordering from her again.

One criticism though is just to offer a photo of the colors of fabric online, I thought it was going to be a little more green and less blue. But still its gorgeous and Im VERY HAPPY!"
96,"The seller worked with me to expedite receiving this item in time for my vacation. It's got a lovely drape and I wore it to a music festival. I felt so beautiful dancing in this flowy dress/cover-up! Thank you, I love this item."
97,"Delivery was extremely fast, material is so luxurious, and it is made to fit my height to perfection! A beautiful coverup,"
98,I received my coverup on yesterday and I am in love! It was perfect!!!! I also appreciated the hand written thank you note that was sent with my purchase. People nowadays normally do not take the time to give this added touch.
99,Absolutely LOVE it. Will definitely be purchasing another! Not too see through and just perfect length. Can't wait to use it in Mexico! Big thanks to Sarah for handling a post office snafu perfectly. ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!
100,Love Sara! Great communication! My caftan is beautifully made! She did an amazing job! Will be ordering from her again! And FAST SHIPPING! :)

102,"Love this coverup! It's so effortlessly chic and feels greats! 
Shipped out fast. I'm very happy with the purchase!"
103,As pictured. Super soft. Fast delivery and professional owner. She responded to my questions fast and shipped soon after payment confirmation. Will order other items in the near future. Oh and she sent the sweetest note with the package.
104,"Perfect length! I'm 6'2"" and Sarah made it just a little bit longer for me :)"
105,This item is one of a kind… So simple yet so so beautiful… That is why I have now ordered for for myself and one for my sister who adores hers as well… I can’t wait to go swimming ❤️❤️❤️

109,"I had a great experience shopping. Everything was quick and easy. Sara was supper easy to work with and her finish work is amazing. I was happy with the quality, product, and service. I think honestly think I got a still. 

Thanks Sara!"
110,"Sarah was more than accomodating. She went beyond my expectations. The coverup is lovely and I can't wait to strut in Vegas.
Thanks again Sarah!!!!"
111,Beautiful work!  Fits amazing and the length was perfect!  Can’t wait to hit the resort with this fashion!  Thank you again for your attentiveness in your customer service.
112,"Excellent service, which included free overnight shipping so my order would arrive on time, and an incredible product. Sarah is an artist."
113,I purchased a long sheer cover up from Sarah and it's prefect! Exactly what I was looking for. She is such a pleasure to work with! She responded to every email so quickly answered all my questions. I will definitely purchase from her again!
114,This Sheer Coverup is so beautiful! It's the perfect item for instant elegance. Thank you so much for this. Great seller and speedy delivery.

136,Great cover up. Thank you!
137,Great to work with in regards to customizations and prompt responses. Thank you!
138,Perfect blue chiffon- my wife loves it
139,"The kaftan is well made and the material is of very good quality. Best yet, the item wasn’t just sewn on the sides with a hole at the top like a glorified pillow case (which is what I was expecting).  The stitching along the sides was actually a little closer to the body giving the piece more shape, which flattered the body while retaining volume and flowiness."
140,Absolutely LOVE it. Can't wait to actually wear it. :)
141,AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!! GREAT SERVICE as well!  Thanks again :)
142,"Great communication, super fast shipping, and gorgeous cover-up! Thank you:-)"
143,Item meets expectations.  I'm very pleased and do refer others to shop.
144,"Love it, fast shipping, thank you!"
145,Absolutely love this swimsuit! Fits perfectly and very sexy! My only wish is that it came with bottom liner....especially after exiting the water. :)
146,"Super sexy bathing suit!!!  I did not think it would fit, but its perfect!!"
147,Love it! Beautiful items and shipping was quick! Very happy!
148,"Wonderful one piece swimsuit, looks wonderful on her and more importantly, she loves it!! Arrived in the designated time frame."
149,"The swim suit is a pretty color and beautifully cut, but the material is SO THIN. I hope it doesn't rip and leave me exposed. Very flimsy construction. I feel like I should always have a change of clothes just in case😕"
150,It's a nice looking suit
151,This is a beautiful swimsuit. Love it!
152,"Beautiful, eccentric bathing suit!  Fits Perfect!  Thanks!"
153,"Fits well, except for the occasional nip-slips hehe :)"
154,Beautiful swimsuit and so soft. Quick delivery. Thanks!
155,"I love this top! I feel so free and comfortable :) 
 Thank you so much for the beautiful bracelet!"
156,I love the colors very comfortable. I did have to sew my own padding in though
157,it fit very well. i love it!
158,"The shipping was great. The color in the picture is very accurate. I'm  a DDD, so it just didn't cover me enough. I need more support too. This is probably better suited for teenagers to 30ish!"
159,fits good....light weight....can stretch or scrunch as you want
160,Love it! Fits great:)
161,Der Artikel hat sehr lange Gebraucht bis er ankam.
162,Love this bikini top! Very comfortable and fits great
163,It's so comfortable and freeing. I can just go lay out with no lines and no ties hurting my neck and back
164,Just as described looks beautiful! Only issue is too big
165,It took a while to arrive but my daughter won't wear the item because there is no lining in the swimsuit top! None!
166,"LOVED this bathing suit! It rides a little high above your hip bone so make sure you're used to wearing high wasted items before buying! I am 5'2"" and ordered a M/L which fit perfectly, thank you!!!"
167,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE this swim suit ! Cute and functional , and she did the fonts and lettering EXACTLY how I asked ! My measurements are 34-27-37 (im a 4/6 in dresses) (sz8 in jeans) and I got the medium/large and it fits perfectly!!! I will definitely be purchasing another in the future! Thank you !!! God bless. ?"
168,"I really like my suit! I'm 5'1 and around 120 pounds with a curvy figure and I got a small. The sides hit me at a nice area and I feel like Kylie Jenner when I wear it lol The straps are a little high maintenance because my torso is on the shorter side but not too much of an inconvenience. I recommend getting one, they're so much fun👍🏼"
169,"Great service, helped me alot with sizing. I'm very small, 158cm and thin. I bought the M/L and I'm glad I did! Fits perfectly and looks so beautiful on me. The shoulders are a bit loose but that's an easy fix if you know how to stitch! If you're a bit taller it would fit even more perfectly! It's worth the money! I would buy another one.. (edit: I bought a second one and it was amazing! Perfect text, great quality and again best service!)"
170,"I love this!! I got the custom one piece and I am 5""6 and 130 pounds and got an XL and fits perfectly"
171,LOVED my swimsuit! Medium was perfect for my small/medium  size! Can't wear it enough!!
172,"It fits great! I ordered the S/M before and it did not fit because it was too short in length. I ordered the M/L and it's great! I am 5'5"", 128 lbs, 32C and a little larger in the bottom. Hope this helps others!"
173,Worked alright for what I was doing! Wore it for a concert with shorts. But I'm usually a small all around and this was just a little to low since my torso is long. I do suggest a side up if you are busty. Seller was very helpful!
174,"These bathing suits are adorable!!! They are very high quality! They come with padding which is super nice. The seller was INCREDIBLE to work with - very fast to respond & answered all of our questions. These suits do run smaller (as the sizing charts and other reviews say). We are a group of 6 people and we range in height from 5'0"" to 5'10"". The XL worked for all of us since we're built so differently. Will definitely be ordering again!"
175,"Love my swimsuit!! Fits great and the color and lettering is perfect. I may remove the cups because they don't fit very well with my body, but other than that it's awesome and the low back is very flattering! I recommend ordering a size up. I am 5'5 and 120 lbs and normally I'm a 0-2 and wear S, but I got a M/L based on reviews and I'm so glad I did!"
176,I put my name on it and absolutely love this suit. I got so many compliments and everyone has been asking me where I got it. The shipping was super fast. I ordered it on a Monday and got it within the week. I am currently ordering more!
177,Love the suit. It's amazing! Shows a bit much more than I thought but hey it's for vegas in April! I ordered a medium but I have a long torso so I think I should've gotten a large to be safe. I'm 5'5 130 lbs.
178,Thank you so much ! I couldn’t be happier with how quickly it came and how perfect it fit and turned out ! Thanks again !!!
179,This shop is now my all time favorite. They did an amazing job on this one piece swimsuit for our pregnancy announcement! The owner was extremely responsive to me in a very timely manner. Thank you so much ADashofChic!
180,I recently got married and I ordered a custom bathing suit to wear at a celebration with close family and friends. The owner was very responsive and got this item out to me quick with the rush ship option. It fits perfect. Love this!
181,Runs very small! Excellent customer service and fast turn around time for a custom order. The first suit I ordered was way too small and she helped me rush order the next size up so I would have it in time for a music festival. I'm a dress size 6 and pants size 8 at 5'8 and I needed the XL. It's still a but too short in the torso. The crotch it cut really really high and that's my only complaint. If you are shorter and thinner then they would fit better. I just wear mine as a body suit w shorts and it looks sexy as hell.
182,"OMG I love this suit!!! Does it fit perfectly? No, but it's awfully close (just a little big in the shoulders). It's a swimsuit, so it is a little risky buying it before you can try it on. But I'm so glad I took a chance. My ""Body By Cake"" swimsuit is gonna get a lot of play in 2017!"
183,"The people were wonderful! I emailed them on a Friday asking if they could have a custom swimsuit to me by the following Friday, and I had it in my hands on Wednesday.

As far as the swimsuit goes, I am 5'4"" and 125 lbs, and I normally wear a size 2. I ordered a medium swimsuit, and I felt like I should have gotten a large because I felt too tall for the swimsuit. If you aren't sure about sizing, I would highly recommend emailing them and asking."
184,"Pictures turned out great for my bachelorette! The suit ran a bit small. I am 5'6"", 115 lbs and it was stretching pretty low on the neckline. The service has been excellent."
185,"The seller was very friendly and responsive. I am 5' 7"" and 115 pounds and I ordered a M/L. It fits me well so I would recommend sizing up!"
186,"Suit was cute! I ended up going for a size Large (I'm 5.3"", 117 lbs) in the white (since apparently the white is lined and doesn't stretch as much?) and found it WAY too long for me. Took it in to get the straps adjusted and it fit fine but would have probably been better off with a Medium. Otherwise, suit was just what I wanted and arrived quickly!"
187,Really Cute! I usually wear a size small and the medium was a little snug so order a size or two up!
188,"Swim suit is great material and suuuper cute! My boobs are too big and I think my torso was a little too long.. I ordered the XL, I'm 5'9 and a 36DD. I'm still going to wear it with shorts though."
189,"I ordered these custom bathing suits for a bachelorette party and they came out amazing. I even had to cancel a last minute bathing suit and the vendor had no problem working with me. 

I will defintily recommend you to my friends for future purchases. Thank you so much for everything!!"
190,"This item shipped quick and came as ordered. I'm 5'3"" and weigh 122, I got a medium. All and all, I love the way it fits. It does cut low in the front, but nothing too terrible. The straps are a little awkward but that is just due to the fully opened back. I bought this for a halloween costume and it's going to work perfectly."
191,"Such cute suits!! My cousins and I ordered them for a family vacation and loved them. Sizing is tricky but we spent a while reviewing the size charts and other reviews to determine what would fit us best. I'm 5'8"", 135 lbs, 36C and the small tall suit fit perfectly. Slight issue with the print of the text that the store owner was more than happy to help resolve. Thanks again!"
192,"The swimsuit is great quality, much better than I expected. However, it is much smaller than I thought and I sized up. I'm 5 foot 5, 32 bust and 128 lbs and I ordered a M/L, but the swimsuit was too short. Make sure you read the reviews and contact the shop and you'll get a better idea of what you should order! I'm definitely ordering again because the quality is great."
193,"Shipped super fast and turned out perfect! I will say order a size too big as they run a little small, but that is with any swimsuit! This was great and love, love, love the suit!"
194,The suit was perfect for my birthday trip to Spain! And the seller was fantastic with communication!! Thank you!
195,"The suit looks absolutely amazing. Runs a bit small, but if you ask the seller beforehand about what size you need, she is very good about getting you the right size. I'm 5'10 and muscular build and the XL fit perfectly (was tall enough for my torse, etc)!"
196,Absolutely love my custom suit! Fits true to size and the lettering is perfect. It was the best thing to bring with my on my most recent vacation and I will definitely be buying more from this vendor!
197,"If you have a long torso and perky under C-cup boobs I wouldn't recommend this for you. Great quality, beautiful writing but just doesn't fit right at all."
198,The quality is great! There’s padding in the suit which is something I had never seen a one piece! The owner of the shop is extremely professional! I will be buying from this shop again and recommend it to everyone!
199,Fast Friendly service! Suit runs a little small but fits! Thank you so much!
200,Item shipped quickly and fit perfectly! The text looked great too. Can't wait to wear this on the beach!
201,The shop owner went above and beyond to make sure we got this order on time for our event! Thank you so much for making us and our clients happy.
202,Perfect in every way! Highly recommend this shop for your bridal kini needs! Seller is easy to work with and very quick in provided product and response :) can't wait to have it on in Vegas
203,The swimsuits are perfect! The sewn in cups were a nice surprise. Will definitely purchase again.
204,I just received my swimsuit and I LOVE IT! I want to give a detailed review considering there was a few mentions on the sizing of the swimsuits. The communication with the seller was top notch. She answered all my questions quickly and fulfilled my order fast since I'm leaving on vacation next week. The color and the letters look fantastic. I made sure to communicate with the shop regarding any concerns I had regarding the fit. She was so helpful and gave her recommendation as to the sizing. I am 5'2 and weigh 140 pounds. I'm big on top (Size D Cup) but smaller on the bottom. The swimsuit covers my girls perfectly and holds them in tight! The bathing suit has a slightly higher cut but not so high that would make anyone feel uncomfortable if that's not your preference. I ordered an XL and it fit perfect! THANK YOU ❤
205,I absolutely love ❤️ everything i bought! Plus it was beautifully wrapped 🎁
206,The suit was and is fantastic.
207,"SO Cute, gold color and quality of suit is GREAT. SUPER fast from order to delivery!"
208,The suit came quickly and the owner was happy to answer questions and work with me to create what I wanted. Would highly recommend!
209,Exactly as pictured and fast shipping!!! Absolutely love!!!
210,"This item shipped quickly and she sent me a proof before she printed it which was very helpful. However, the sizing is misleading. I am 5’6 and small chested I ordered a medium and when it arrived it is VERY SHORT. It fit fine around the waist, but it is so short it cannot be worn even uncomfortably. These suits are for short/very short torsoed women. A friend who is 5’2 ordered a large and it is still very short on her where she needs to reorder in a tall size. Also, I imagine if your are big breasted the way the straps wrap around your shoulders in the back it would cut in to your armpits and be very uncomfortable. Great service, but terribly described sizing."
211,"Bottom line: I really like this suit! The only reason it's not 5 stars is because the suit itself is a little too snug around my booty. I am not particularly curvy but I do have little butt and when I walk the suit rides up to the middle of my cheeks. It's not too tight that it cuts off my leg circulation but it does come up. When I walk I am frequently adjusting the bottom of the suit. The rest of the suit fits perfectly and offers great chest coverage. The open back adds just a touch of sexiness without being too revealing. The material is great quality and the wording is straight and even. Overall, it's a great suit."
212,"Seller was diligent in expediting my order for a birthday party, also love that the suit has cups! Good Quality."
213,RUNS EXTREMELY SMALL! I am usually a med and the XL did not fit at all!
214,My swimsuit turned out great! Definitely recommend ordering a size up.
215,I received amazing customer service from the shop and everything shipped in time for my trip! I would highly recommend ordering from them!
216,I'm in love! Great product and very professional! Quick turnaround also!
217,Thank you so much ! So cute :)
218,It was perfect thank you!
219,Super cute and great quality
220,I ordered a size larger than I normally wear (size 2) and it fits well. Shop owner was quick to answer any question.
221,Great Quality! Definitely recommend this shop.
222,"Overall, I would like to give ADashofChic a 5 star rating. It is always difficult when ordering a bathing suit that you cannot try on before you purchase. I was very nervous about this but needed this suit in particular for a group bachelorette party.

When I first received the swimsuit, it did not fit right. I am 5'2"" 120lbs and ordered a M/L. The front of the suit was a little low in front and the straps were a little loose. I contacted the shop and they were extremely helpful in listening to any concerns I had. I was able to send in my concerns and they quickly fixed the issue to ensure my suit fit to my standards. I really appreciated the great (and fast) customer service to fix my concern."
223,Cute but sizes run small. Loved the personalize
224,Everything was great . It just took forever to get shipped.
225,The quality of the suit itself is poor. If I were to go in the water you would be able to see right through it. The lettering and customization was nice. The quick service and shipment was also nice. I wouldn't order another or again.
226,I ordered a size S/M which I thought would've fit because I'm short and petite but the swimsuit was way too small.. I'm disappointed I waisted my money.
227,"Shipped very quickly. Material is very nice. I have a large bust and didn't realize it is quite low cut in the front as well, so keep that in mind when ordering. 
No complaints about the suit though, it was made exactly as I ordered"
228,"Shipped very quickly and looked great, but the arm holes were very tight and fit loosely in the back"
229,Gave this as a gift. My friend really liked it. It was great quality but did run really small. Size way up!
230,fit was not great. top didn't fit well
231,Quick shipping and great communication
232,fit everywhere except the top. the strains were too big
233,the arms were too tight :(
234,Great communication. Fit exactly as I expected!
235,I am disappointed...my name is not centered therefore it looks funny and I won’t be wearing it. My name is 7 letters therefore the 4 letter should be centered.
236,"I never got my item .... although i was keep asking but the only response to wait and when a case raised the seller was upset about case more than not getting my item and when i asked to have my item , she claims that she will refund ... very rude"
237,"Suit is good quality, although there isn't an easy way to keep the removable pads in place.  Im 5'2 and 110 and I ordered a medium.  I can see how this suit would be a difficult fit for someone taller.  My biggest issue was that the wording on my custom swimsuit was wrong the first time around, and I was asked to pay shipping for the corrected custom order.  This seemed ridiculous to me since I very clearly specified the details of my custom order the first time around.  I agreed to pay because I needed the swimsuit for an obligation, however the shop owner was rude and blamed me for the error even after I sent screenshots of the original order."
238,I love my swimsuit. Fits like a glove. I asked for very specific customization and I was given exactly what I asked for. I'm very happy with my purchase. Thank you!!
239,Love this bathing suit so much! It fits perfect and dealing with Anthony was awesome. I wanted it delivered a little faster than standard shipping and he was totally easy to work with and made + shipped it fast so I could still wear it a few times this summer. Thank you!
240,"I have unusual proportions and a long torso, so I've never been able to find a one-piece swimsuit in a store that fit well enough to wear out. Anthony made the suit to match my measurements, and it fits perfectly! I've never had a suit come close to looking this good. He was quick to respond and made sure every detail was to my liking, even taking the time to make an adjustment that I needed. 

I'll definitely be buying more in other colors and cuts, and I'm recommending this seller to all of my long-torsoed friends!"
241,I bought this swimsuit from this shop and I was amazed by the customer service. I had chosen the pink color and he messaged me to ensure he was positive which pink I wanted. He was then very helpful when the tracking on the package was not updating. When I received the item I was thrilled by how well it was made! Would definitely purchase from this shop again.
242,I love my tribe pocahontas swimsuit. Its so comfy! Great material superior making. Communication with Anthony has been a pleasure. He is kind and cares about his costumers. Will definitely purchase again. Thank you Anthony 😊
243,This suit is perfect!Fits great and the quality is superb.Was shipped and delivered on time.Worth the wait.I am very happy with this purchase!!!!
244,"I bought this bathingsuit in red and love it, fits perfectly! I will definitely order from here again. Very great customer service and got it very quickly. 10/10 will order from here again."
245,"Love love love this suit! I have never had a one piece fit me so well. Also awesome customer service, responds quickly and very detailed! Can’t wait to order another one!"
246,"Bought this for my wife to wear on our upcoming holiday to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary & wasn't sure she'd like it or dare to wear it (she seems to think she's too old for this sort of thing). Item arrived quickly in a beautiful gift box, the care and quality were clearly evident and because it was made to her measurements it fit perfectly. Not only does she look sensational in it she's tried it on 3 or more times since she got it (we're not going away until December!), and says she feels amazing in it. Can't recommend product or company highly enough, very happy customer & delighted wife, can't wait to see her model it by the pool, thank you!"
247,Lovely swimsuit. Very well sewn.
248,"Très joli dommage que la doublure interne soit rose -> quand mouillé prend une teinte rosé et sur la photo la couleur milk donnait plus blanc que en vrai c'est plutôt blanc cassé 

Sinon belle pièce, très bonne qualité"
249,"Amazing,my wife is tall and was afraid the suit would not fit. Anthony requested additional measurements and the suit fit perfectly. My wife liked that it was lined and made with good quality fabric. The Brazilian cut was flirty and cheeky but not obscene.it arrived in a beautiful gift package."
250,Fast shipping. Super cute bathing suit I wear it all the time!! Only downside was stitching was poorly done
251,"I LOVE LOVE this bathing suit. I am always a little weird buying anything online but I sent off my measurements and it came just as it said! I sent pictures to all my friends and now they’re asking where I got it. Thank you again, LucyBea 😊"
252,"Its super cute! However, the fit it a bit lopsided. One side of the top is larger than the other...I just have to tuck one side a bit. But! Its not extremely noticeable! I love the color."
253,"I loved my suit!

Shipped quickly, I especially loved the bottoms.
Being 6 ft. I always strike out when it comes to bottoms. I’m a M but most mediums feel like XS’s on me, yet L’s don’t fit. I felt like these actually fit how women are shaped 🙌🏽 Thank you Lucy! Love the blue 😍."
254,"Sorry that I didn't capture a better pic of the suit while I was in it! Really like this shop and the ability to customize your suits. Good quality and comfortable in & out of the water. Fit like a dream! The only thing was that the top was a little bit longer than I thought it would be compared to the pictures on the site, more like a crop top, but it was still really cute!! Love this. 5 stars"
255,"I absolutely love my bikini!!! It is very well made and i feel like it will last a long time. I bought this for a vacation im going on in may..its january... i cant stop trying to on, i just love it!!! Im probanly going to buy two more so i can wear a different one everyday im on the beach.. lol.. the only thing i would change is the cut of the bottoms.. i wish it was a bit more cheeky to pull up higher over my hips. 10/10 ** it did take a while to get here so keep that in mind when ordering but its worth the wait! Thank you!"
256,i had to send back because there was a minor stitching complication but seller was so nice and fixed them and sent them back (: she personalized the suits to my sizes so it fits like a glove!
257,"I LOVE this bikini! The shop owner was so nice! I ordered the swim suit without sending my measurements by accident, and didn't realize it until over a week later. I really wanted the bikini to fit well, so I messaged LoveLucyBea with my measurements asking if she could add them into my order even though I was so late, and she did! She was so kind and accommodating about my mistake and made sure that I got a bikini that fit well and that I loved (I do!). It took awhile to get my order (which is normal for any carefully hand-made item), so don't expect this item to be there super quickly after your purchase. However, it is absolutely worth the wait! I will definitely be ordering another swim suit from LoveLucyBea in the future."
258,"You are so awesome!  And patient (with my million questions and address change).  The bathing suit was fabulous, as always.  This is my daughters 3rd one and she LOVES it.  Thank you!"
259,My new favorite bathing suit! only complaint is part of the  stitching was unraveling a little but I quickly fixed it.
260,Great swimsuit! I am 5ft 4in and weight 120lbs I ordered a small. I also sent in my measurements and the suit fits great and is great quality!
261,Adorable suit. Quick shipping and Lucy was super responsive and made the suit exactly as I wanted.
262,"Wanted to love it...Unfortunately the zigzag stitching was poorly done and was falling out before I even had a chance to try it on. Wish it wasn't falling apart :( Despite the quality (maybe it was a one time fluke?) seller was great with sizing and wonderful in answering all my questions prior to purchase.  

UPDATE: Lucy reached out to me to fix the issue. Great customer service. Thank you, Lucy!"
263,Super quick delivery and I'm obsessed with this bathing suit! Excellent fit and so beautiful! Thank you!
264,"This is such a cute bikini! I was a bit worried that this wouldn't suit me, but its fantastic! Great attention to detail and a really flattering shape, can't wait to take this out to the pool to catch some sun! Thanks so much for the beautiful bikini!!!"
265,I got two.  Obsessed. I want more.
266,"The bottoms are a little tight, but I like the cut so if I re purchase I'll go a size up. I'm typically size 0-2 and bought XS, so I need S. Love the color (Wine). Top is great."
267,"fantastic! arrived insanely quickly when I told her I needed it soon, and it looks great!"
268,"Beautiful color (bought in red), received the bikini about 3 weeks after I placed the order. I gave my size/measurements and it fits perfectly! However, the front of the bottoms were unexpectedly skimpy. I'm used to minimal coverage on my butt, but feel a little naked in the front. The top is perfect tho!"
269,I highly recommend this shop! The seller communicates fast and is very understanding if you have any problems with your order!
270,"The bikini color is exactly what I wanted. The bottoms fit just as I was hoping as well :) 

However, the top is uneven.. definitely noticeable that one side has more fabric. I doesn’t look too bad on so overall I’m happy."
271,"This is by far the best fitting swimsuit i’ve ever had. I am so in love with it! The top doesnt have cups so if you’re uneasy about your nips poking through then beware, but it’s good material and doesn’t even seem handmade. I’m definitely going to purchase in another color"
272,Really cute!!! I wish the top was a little tighter but overall it's nice!
273,"Really Love the design, and even the craftsmanship of the folding etc.!! Some of the surging was not as neat as I would have expected, otherwise well pleased."
274,"Really cute, bottoms fit alittle big and aren't as cheeky as I'd like, but other than that really nice for the price. Lovely customer service and great materials used. Can't beat it for the price"
275,Recieved my order super quick. Way faster than anticipated. Bikini fit like glove and hugs all the right places. Only thing that was a little weird for me was the crotch area was too wide and causes the material to bunch up but nothing major. Material is high quality (better quality than my victoria secret bikinis). Will definetely order from again!
276,Exactly what I was expecting! Loved it!
277,Bottoms were a little small and the seems did rip a little but still fit well. One of my favorites I've ordered
278,I got her swimsuit it took awhile but finally got it and when I got it I tried it on and the too was lol sided and uneven and the bottom weren't sewed correctly all around it was uneven and I do not think it was worth this much money but it's cute
279,"I'm not a huge fan of the material/ fit, but the red color is great!"
280,Great fit! True to size
281,Exactly as pictured! And fits perfectly!
282,I absolutely love my bathing suit except the bottom is a little small .. can I order a medium bottom
283,lovely bathing suit!! fits great
284,"Really like the top, but it shows a little too much nipple to where I need to find extra padding now."
285,It was way too big on the bottom.It was a tight fit on the top
286,"I never received this order, but apparently since it said it delivered via USPS then I'm responsible.  So I don't know what it looks like.  Terrible."
287,"The fabric is better than what we currently use as main stream bathing suit fabric meaning it dries quickly and is much more form fitting in and out of the water. I love that this was custom made for my body measurements, it fits like a glove. This is the best bathing suit I've ever owned. It looks just like the picture."
288,"I loveeeee my swimsuit!! Liliya was friendly, courteous, and extremely helpful! She went above and beyond to alter my swimsuit and make sure it fit perfectly before my vacation. I've wanted this bathing suit for three years and it was worth every penny. It accentuated my curves and made my butt look amazing! It's made with high quality material and to my surprise, the suit wasn't uncomfortable at all. She was very fast in shipping out my order and pretty quick with her responses. She even included a thank you note in the packaging and a percentage off on the next order. Would definitely order from Liliya again, I felt beautiful in this custom swimsuit. Thank you so much Liliya!"
289,"I absolutely LOVE my swimsuit! It fits perfect and it looks great on. I didn't even want to take it off after trying it on. I can't wait to pick out my next purchase. I also love the fact that owner took the time to write me a thank you card, which shows she truly loves what she does and is genuine."
290,"This swimsuit is great quality and looks exactly like the photo. It’s also very flattering. I sent in my measurements and received my swimsuit within 4 days. I am a very hard fit, I was on a time crunch for a vacation and LILYSHdesign saved my life. I will definitely order from this company again."
291,Amazing and so sexy I cant stop staring at myself in the mirror
292,Dynamite suit- and super Fab customer service!!!!
293,I absolutely loved the way this bathing suit fit and was made. It was very flattering! It was shipped on time and I had a great experience with Lily. She was very sweet and helpful. She replied to my messages in a timely manner and I would definitely buy from her again. :)
294,"Absolutely love my new bandage swimsuit!!! Not only does it fit perfectly, I requested for it to be shipped quickly since I was leaving on vacation and she shipped it to me just in time!! Great communication! Definitely would recommend!"
295,This item was received in a timely manner. I loved the fit! It was as sexy in person as on the site and definitely a standout from other bikinis out there! Would highly recommend!
296,"I really like my swimsuit...there was problem with my shipment, but when I contacted Liliya about my package it was sent out right away...Also, I received a beautiful handwriting card from the designer...I will be getting more pieces in the near future!"
297,"It is beautiful! It was shipped on time, but USPS was sooooooo slow. Ha ha. It was worth the wait though. Thank you!"
298,Shipped quickly! I love this swimsuit. It fits very well and is great quality- and it looks fantastic. I'm very happy with it.
299,"It shipped to me right on time, fits even better than I imagined and I know I'll be the only one on the beach with the item! I've never been happier with a purchase in my life."
300,"Amazing !!! Best swim suit I've ever bought ! , looks exactly like the model and was in perfect condition I was on a time crunch and the seller accommodated me! I could never be so greatful"
301,"I love that this monokini is custom made and it's so unique! Very well made and 100% worth every penny, thank you so much!"
302,Great communication. Timely. And I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the swimsuit! Thanks so much! You gained a loyal customer!
303,LOVE this piece. so much fun to wear.
304,Absolutely stunning bathing suit! The seller was fair regarding the price as it did not fit perfectly and I needed to make adjustments. Good communication and would buy here again.
305,This swimsuit was everything i wanted it to be and more. Liliya was very pleasant to work with and I will def look to order from her again.
306,Liliya was very promp and professional. I got my suit in record time and it fits great. Thank you so much!
307,TOP TOP TOP!!!
308,gorgeous! i just loved it!
309,Amazing work. Not cheap and fits amazing!! Thank you. Will be buying more!!
310,"I like the material and I really like the overall cut. The seller was very communicative, specially prior to the order being placed and then once placed, to ensure the item would fit prior to being dispatched. The top part fit like a glove, and the lower part wasn't too bad. It requires some minor tucking in, but this is something I can get done on my own. Overall, I'm happy with my item :)"
311,Love the swimsuit! So happy with it!
312,She Loved it and it fit perfect. Thanks for taking the time with the wrapping.
313,SUPER SEXY!!!  Fits great!!! Loved it!!
314,I love it! Can't wait for beach season!
315,This fits beautifully and I just love how unique it looks! Very well made and very quick shipping! Thank you so much!
316,so chic & unique. love that it's a bk brand! fabric is quality
317,Cute swimsuit
318,Communications with the seller before the purchase was pleasent so even when my last question wasn't answered it made me still confident in purchasing. I got a custom fit and it worked out great and the swimsuit looks truly amazing. Somehow I however feel this is more for looks than anything else as it doesnt feel overly compfy to move around in. It's a heavy kind of material and looks really sexy though. So you definately get what you see. The turn around and shipping was fast as well. Thank you.
319,Great swimsuit that fits great. Glad there were multiple options for the rear of the swimsuit.
320,"Took a long time to ship this item. I ordered on the 8th it did not ship until the 22nd. However, it was worth the wait because it was beautifully made. A bit large for me in the torso because I am short, but luckily I can sew so itll just need a few adjustments to be perfect. Word to the wise, if you arent as tall as the models pictured and you fall within the low range of the measurements for that size, order a size down just to be safe.  The material stretches so it wont be too much of a problem. The seller was extremely kind and helpful and I would purchace from her again."
321,"love it, well made and lovely customer service! Thank you"
322,"comfortable, well made, sexy as hell, and an absolute perfect fit - how much better could it be?"
323,Not very flattering on my body but still a great swim suit. Shipped on time.
324,So comfortable and GORGEOUS! Love it! Will definitely be taking it on my Hawaiian vacation next month!
325,"i love it, thanks so much"
326,It's beautiful I love the color!
327,Quickly! Qualitatively! Beautifully! I am happy)))
328,SUPER!
329,"Beautiful bathing suit, and very flattering! Liliya is great, and super accommodating. Thanks!"
330,Loved the swimsuit! Met my expectations. I hate how long it took to ship and receive. Plus my poor communication. I would make another purchase but will be prepared to wait 3 weeks.
331,"Shipping was extremely delayed, but she was very gracious and made up for it. The product is great and as it appears on the website. Would purchase others from this seller."
332,So sexy and original! Looks exactly like the pic
333,This swimsuit is HOTTTTTTT! Thanks so much :)
334,"Cute suit, but not made properly for anyone over a size 2."
335,It came really fast. It also fits pretty good
336,A little bit big in the waist area but I still love it.
337,"The item isn't bathing suit material at all, it is just thick elastic bands, very inexpensive stuff I wish I would have made it myself. It didn't fit at all and I have the same measurements as those listed for the model but I have a bigger bust and that was the loosest part. The places the elastic band is sewed together is thick, stiff and hard and does not form to the body. The only part that is bikini material is the tiny thong/crotch area.  The seller is really nice. I just don't think the material looks like whats pictured nor does it fit that way and the price is outrageous for the product. Very disappointed as this was saved in my favorites for ages and then I finally got it and it is far from what it seems."
338,The suit fits beautifully! Thank you!
339,Such a unique and sexy bathing suit! My wife loves it and so do I!
340,Took a long time for this package to arrive and it didn't really fit right
341,GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! Thank you!
342,Nicely made.  Needs a little tailoring but good design
343,"Excellent, professional service and shipping.	Great seller !!! A+++"
344,as described -- thanks! :)
345,Item got undelivered and until now I haven't received any reply from you.
346,"Is not like we want, pour quaity and it not the color that we bought"
347,My wife loved it!
348,It's not a good fit and refunds aren't accepted.
349,Very poor quality don't waste your money
350,"Beautiful suit, material is soft and the cut is perfect! Thank you💙"
351,I love it !!!
352,I wasn't sure about the fabric since I've never had a swimsuit n this kind of material. But...... I love it! Ultra comfy and sexy. I'll be buying another in the near future!
353,"This bikini is like no other! It's beautiful, comfortable, and has a carefree, bohemian look. It's also unlined, which I like. So happy with this purchase!"
354,"Beautiful and comfy bikini, fits perfectly, and thank you for helping me find the right size.
Thank you!!!"
355,Love the way this bikini fits. It covers the side boob area so there's no uncomfortable spillage there! Sizes were perfect and easy to adjust with the ties. I want another pair for my vacation!
356,"Beautiful and comfy bikini, fits perfectly and size can be adjusted easily if needed. Thank You very much!"
357,"Gorgeous color, exactly like the picture! Great customer service :)"
358,The suit itself is very cute- the problem is that upon wearing in the water it has no elasticity to it like swimwear would have and it stretches out and no longer conforms to your butt. So the sides are all flared out after getting out of the water after the first wear. Not very flattering. Material also is kind of just a thin cotton or something that does not dry well. Two hours later laying in the full sun the suit was still totally wet and felt kind of uncomfortable. A cute design but wish it was more useable. Living in Hawaii where I need a lot of wear it’s not a very viable option.
359,Just as described. Thank you!
360,"Tie dye not as described. Ended up being a dark blue gray color, barley even looks tie dyed. I do like the fit overall but one string on the bottoms is cut so thin & short I’m afraid it will rip off one day not too far in the future. Not usually one to complain, but for the price I expected something better. Would not order from this shop again."
361,"exactly what I was looking for! alot more affordable than other similar products Ive seen, great price. Only paid $3 for shipping, and the shipping only took 3 days from california to new jersey! love the tie sides, scrunch, and how to material has a little bit of a sheen to it. cant wait till it gets warm enough to wear it!"
362,"This bikini bottom is great quality and the back part it's so damn hot ! Makes your butt look rounder and with a nice shape , shipping was decently fast , and the quality is really good , I got it in size XS and it fits me perfectly (I'm normally a size S in victoria secret)"
363,"Great fit and design, very flattering on your booty and comfortable but i can't give more stars because it is made of a very cheap fabric. It reminds me of the fabric they used to make these bright colored disco leggings in the 80s. The price they charge deserves a real swim suit fabric."
364,"I LOVE my new bikini! I have always wanted one in white but was concerned it would be see through. I contacted Drea and she immediately let me know she could double line the front bottoms.Her service is professional, kind, fast and efficient! I will be ordering from her again very soon😍"
365,"Damn, these bottoms are hot! i just received mine and wow, I 
just love them. It is absolutely perfect. I've definitely found
my new favorite bikini bottoms and will wear this design from now on, no question. I've always found bikini bottoms so tricky, to find one that actually looks good and highlights your assets, instead of looking like a diaper however well-shaped your bottoms are. These ones have the perfect amount of coverage, really highlights your shape and follows your body, instead of working against it.
I cant wait to rock these this summer. thanks!

True to size, good material and def. worth the money."
366,It fits perfectly! I love it! It's just perfect! Better then I imagined!!!
367,I wore these to Bali. Let's just say that they accentuated and emphasized my assets and turned a few heads. Well-made and super cute!
368,I wore these to Bali. Let's just say that they accentuated and emphasized my assets and turned a few heads. Well-made and super cute!
369,"Soooo cute. Perfect fit. If you're clumsy, don't get white...."
370,"Absolutely loved their products, bought the white bottoms first, when they arrived they were so F*ing sexy so decided to order a green set and the white top."
371,"These run a little big.   Purchased a white small and it did not quite give me the look I wanted so order a white, XXS, and this one is perfect :)"
372,Very sexy and flattering! Item is well made and doesn't feel flimsy or cheap. Seller was very prompt in answering my questions. Can't wait to wear!
373,LOVE LOVE LOVE. Better quality than I was expecting and would recommend this shop. I will be making more purchases :)
374,Description of size was perfect!! Fits good and fast shipping
375,"Sehr schöne Form, wird leider in nassem Zustand transparent (ist aber für weiß normal bei so dünnem Stoff)"
376,the fit is awesome! thanks for fulfilling my request.
377,Great fit and very cute! Thanks so much!!
378,Shipping was on time and I love the final product!
379,Super cute bikini bottom. Very cheeky!

381,Super cute! Exacty what I was looking for!
382,Cute and true to size!
383,Super cute and fast shipping!! LOVE these bottoms! Thanks!
384,Absolutely perfect! 100% true to image and fit. Will shop again here soon!
385,"This was my second time ordering these bikini bottoms, I love them. There were some issues with delayed shipping this time, but that was due to covid-19 and not the sellers fault. Drea is a great and professional seller."
386,"This was my second time ordering these bikini bottoms, I love them. There were some issues with delayed shipping this time, but that was due to covid-19 and not the sellers fault. Drea is a great and professional seller."
387,"This bikini bottom is definitely MICRO as it says in the name. I won't be able to wear this in the states (except maybe Vegas or Miami), but hope to sport it abroad. I got an XS. I am 5'3"" 125 pounds and wear size 2 bottoms. I think this is really cute if you have a smaller butt. Wish it covered just a bit more so I could wear it on the beaches here (northeast USA)"
388,Fit perfect and fast shipping.
389,Fits true to size.
390,My husband loved these bottoms!
391,"The item is as described! amazing, love!"
392,Thank you! Will definitely order more!
393,Bottoms are awesome! My butt looks fabulous. :)
394,My fiancé LOVES it! The ruching pleats on the bum are an adorable detail :)
395,Taille vraiment très petit. Mais modèle conforme à la photo.
396,"Like the cut, very flattering. The only thing that would have made it better would be to have a nude lining on the inside or thicker, more opaque material used especially since it is white. Felt cost was high considering the overall quality compared to other swim pieces that I have."
397,"Shipping was so fast. Fits perfectly,love these."
398,cute thanks! fast shipping! :)
399,ordered a small which is too large...so reordered in XXS.
400,"Not worth the price , very thin . No time for an exchange"
401,Good transaction and product. Very good
402,Shipped fast! I got a red one- piece swimsuit. Probably would have liked a black one better. True to size! I ordered a size small and I’m 5’5” 135lbs
403,I ordered this bathing suit for my birthday. I looooove it!
404,"Love, love, love! Swimsuit is a really good quality and color is perfect."
405,These swimsuits are SO cute! I absolutely live them
406,Great thank you it will be awesome when I can finally have my bachelorette
407,thank you for the great service!
408,Beautiful! Exactly like the picture and as described! Can't wait to wear it!!
409,"Fast, good quality and good communicators. 10/10 recommend!"
410,Looks amazing on my bride squad team!
411,great gift! letters look just as pictured and good quality suit!
412,"Although, the team was great with customizing my drip squad birthday swimsuits, the colors were completely off and the designs were peeling off upon receipt. They did offer a 15% off discount for my inconvenience, however I will not recommend using them again as I was not satisfied with my purchase. Especially, with purchasing a bulk."
413,"Responsive service, item received as expected."
414,"I love this bikini it looks exactly like the picture and it fits amazingly! It came in 2 1/2 weeks and Dragana answered all my questions, I'm probably buying another pair soon! :)"
415,"these suits are amazing quality and well worth the price!! plus it arrived way faster than I expected. I wore it on my trip to mexico and it was perfect! I got so many compliments. the only thing is that for me, the bottoms were just a tad too low in the front. I messaged dragana and she gave me some tips about stretching it but is still making me a new pair anyways! she's honestly one of the kindest souls I have talked to. I will definitely be buying more of these suits! (hopefully I'll have them all someday😉) seriously thank you so much dragana!"
416,"I absolutely love this bikini!! It is everything I hoped it would be and so much more. It fits beautifully and looks so pretty on. I really can't say enough how over the moon I am with it! I can not wait for my travels to start in sunnier climates in January so I can wear it all the time.
I was very impressed with how quick the delivery was too, especially as she makes them to order. I ordered two bikini because I liked the look of them so much and they both arrived in post in just two weeks! I am equally in love with the other bikini too. They are by far my most favourite bikinis ever!!

I highly recommend any one to getting one. I'm sure you will fall in love with yours too! 

Lovely friendly customer care.

Thanks again dragana for your beautiful bikinis. Your a very talented lady :)"
417,"GORGEOUS! Absolutely stunning bikini, I've never felt sexier and better about myself in a swim suit! Dragana was great, she shipped it express to make it in time for my vacation on her dime!  I received many compliments and urge you to try it out! Just be sure you plan for international shipping time, don't expect it overnight.  It is a handmade, unique product after all!  It also dried quickly, and wasn't see-through at all like I've seen with cheaper crochets in stores.  I got the cheeky bottom - super sexy, but if you are looking to be more PG get another bottom style.  Very happy with my purchase! Thanks so much!"
418,This bathing suit is BEAUTIFUL! Dragana is so professional and helpful. She went out of her way to get me the bathing suit ready for my trip. I am now considering ordering a new one! THANK YOU SO MUCH DRAGANA!
419,Love my bathing suit!! It took a long time to get there but you're obviously going to have that for handmade products but the quality is great and I love it 😍
420,"I loved the Bikini as it was so soft and beautifully made. Every detail was perfect. Dragana was so quick to respond every single time! I had an issue with ordering the wrong size and she was happy to help me by making me a new one and re-sending it. 
I am very happy with this item as it also my first crochet item ever! 

Thank you Dragana!"
421,My bikini is gorgeous! It’s tightly woven so there won’t be any issues when I get in and out of the water like most crochet bikinis. Beautiful quality and it fits perfectly ❤️
422,Fit perfectly (:
423,I absolutely love my bikini!! Dragana was very friendly and got my swimsuit to me quickly! The suit itself is very high quality and definitely worth the price!
424,"This is for sure my new favorite bikini! The shop even emailed me to make the top a custom fit for me. Fits great, looks so cute. Will be buying more"
425,⭐️ Magnifique ⭐️
426,Just like the pic. Fits perfectly. Thank you!!
427,"Nein, leider musste ich sehr lange auf das Bikini warten. Jedoch ist er wunderschön, sitzt perfekt und ist toll verarbeitet."
428,SO cute and well made!! It is very flattering and such a cute design <3
429,Beautiful quality! Seller has amazing customer service! Highly recommend :)
430,"It looks exactly like the picture, I love it. It is a prefect fit as measurements where requested."
431,Best quality very nice work
432,So very happy! Great customer service
433,Really gorgeous bikini :) i love it!
434,"This suit is so comfy and fits perfectly! I was worried because I am a size 4 but I have DDs. I ordered a Medium and it's great! You can really adjust since it's a halter style, make the knot as tight or as loose as you want. The fabric at the top of the suit is the real marvel: It can spread out for more coverage or you can wear it skinnier for a sexier more showy look. (Hello sideboob!) I got so many compliments. I have never been this happy with a swimsuit. Also the owner of this shop is SO nice and helpful! Will definitely order another one in a different pattern next summer."
435,Super cute!! As a courtesy I'm NOT posting a picture of me in it. Your welcome!! Good booty coverage and the front is totally different then a typical bathing top!
436,Absolutely gorgeous! I received so many compliments and I felt great wearing it! I bought double sided waterproof tape on Amazon and it didn't feel to revealing. I will purchase another bathing suit soon!
437,"True to size and covers my bum. Love the strip pattern and the high waist. The top straps are nice and wide to cover my chest. I did have to pin the sides to cover some of my side boob, but if that's your thang, you will look stunning. Overall, I like the coverage without looking too modest. Diffidently a show stopper and something different than the average swimsuit!!
-Marita"
438,The item I bought didn't fit because I am small chested and I just didn't like how it looked on my figure. It is a cute swimsuit though. I also highly recommend buying from this seller. She was extremely helpful and sweet about the return. Great customer service!!
439,"I love this suit so much that I am already looking through the other colors and patterns to order another one. It is true to size and it really is form flattering. So cute in so many ways. And I have always been a bikini girl, not anymore!"
440,"This is a great bathing suit and I love it, but it didn’t work for me in person. The seller is super friendly and refunded me quickly!"
441,"I couldn't love my suit more if I wanted to! The fabric is perfect,  the suit fits perfect, and I could not be happier. The shipping was quick, and the seller was so easy and sweet to work with. If I could give more than five stars, I would absolutely give more."
442,It's gorgeous! I love it more than I even expected
443,Absolutely AMAZING!!!! Fits perfect!!!!
444,Fits perfectly and it's super flattering!!! Thank you!!!
445,So stunning and fits beautifully! I have a very petite bust and a very full lower body and this suit was so flattering and beautiful! Thank you!
446,In love with this suit it fits perfectly and is so comfy! I have gotten so many compliments!!!!
447,"Love this swimsuit so many complements very happy and highly
Recommended"
448,Love the suit! Thank you
449,J'adore!! It made quite a *splash* on my vacation with friends.
450,"Great fit and amazing customer service.  Thank you very much.
xoxo"
451,Nice fabric. Bigger than expected.
452,surprised by the excellent quality!! will be back to buy another bathing suit soon
453,Very nice swimming suit and quick delivery
454,"A very cool bathing suit! I love it, others love it too! Fits well, I am happy. 

Two notices: 
1. Maybe it sits better on non slim ladies with more curves. It still fits very well on a slim body, but could be sexier on a different type. 
2. Best for tanning, be careful when swimming because the two strips covering the breasts move easily when not tied tight."
455,"Fit was great!  True to size.  I'm, 5' 6"", 139 lbs, wear a size 4. It was a birthday hit! I did not get in water but wore it all day."
456,"It was a hit!  Great fit and color.  True to size.  I'm a size 4, 5' 6"", 139 lbs. I did not get in water but wore it all day."
457,"Crazy fast shipping! Great quality! If you don’t like for the bathing suit to cut into your hips or ""back fat"", I recommend to size up. I'm 5'7"", 170lbs curvy and got an XL."
458,Just amazing! Loved the suit & speedy turnaround time when I asked. Def a must will be customizing another.
459,Perfect fit! Very fun birthday!
460,Beautiful and fast service!  Highly recommend 💜
461,"Bathing suit fits small but is flattering so I would go up a size when ordering. I wouldn't purchase if you plan on wearing in the water. Went river tubing with ours which was about 2-3 hours and the letters started falling off. We were in the water very minimally given we were on the tubes most of the day. 
Make sure to open your package as soon as you receive it as I was originally shipped the wrong sizes and had to request the correct sizes afterwards. Given shipping time it was tight in getting the second package in time (came day before it was needed). The seller was very responsive to the mix up and sent the right size without any issue."
462,"I’ve purchased two one piece bathing suits from Pom and both are stunning.  Gorgeous pieces, good communication, fast shipping.  She could charge a lot more for these beauties, in my opinion.  Thank you!"
463,"I got this suit for a trip to Mexico and it was great - certainly made really well. I did add the lining in the bottom as well as the push-up top inserts. I would definitely recommend the bottom lining but the push-up pads were kind of awkwardly shaped so I wouldn’t order those in a future suit. This was my first knit/crochet suit so you have to spend a bit of time figuring out how to tie everything so it all fits right. Overall, great service, and a beautiful suit I got a lot of compliments on."
464,Very high quality & fits like a dream - thank you so so much!
465,"Top Artikel, sehr gute Qualität und Verarbeitung. Und ein ganz besonderer, extrem schneller Service und sehr netter individueller Kontakt."
466,"Beautifully made, love the bathing suit!"
467,"Such a cute swimsuit! Thanks, Pom!"
468,So cute! Wish I would’ve bought a bikini too!
469,"It's a perfect fit! I wasn't sure if it's swimmable, but works for that also."
470,"AMAZINGLY fabulous swimsuit! Impeccable construction, super fast shipping and insanely low prices. I will be back! Thank you, thank you!!!!!"
471,Toller Monokini. Immer wieder gerne.
472,Perfect!  Love the black monokini!
473,"Model Costa Azzurra, crochet monokini  is very nice! Nice gift! Excellent!"
474,"Hmmm so I'm a little torn. I really want to love this, but I wish it was made clearer that the bathing stretches when it gets wet, a lot. Which means it doesn't really stay on very well. Also the medium although it was the right width for me it was way too long on my torso. I am going to try and alter it... also if you don't want your vag hanging out ask for lining. I 100% should have gotten that."
475,well made. quick shipping. fits perfectly
476,Unique and very cool! Can't wait to wear it!
477,"Love love love this bathing suit! It’s so cute, it fits amazing and I get so many compliments on it!! You won’t be disappointed!!"
478,Love this suit it fits perfectly. The seller was super kind and worked with me on measurements.
479,Love love LOVE the way this bathing suit fits! I'm very self conscious about wearing bathing suits and I feel VERY confident in this one! It hides my imperfections and accentuates in all the right spots! Seller contacted me for height and weight before making the suit. Very prompt response time too! I am ordering as many suits from them as I can afford!!! :)
480,"Thank you for the lovely customized swimsuit, I love it! Also she has wonderful customer service and super affordable pricing"
481,Wonderful customer service and the suit is perfect!!! Thank you again!!!
482,"Great quality, thank you, fits like a gem."
483,This is everything I wanted and more. I've never felt so confident in a bathing suit before!! Super well made and the color is so vibrant :) Highly recommend this product and seller!! (This is an XL for size reference)
484,"5/5🌟! The fabric is SO soft, it is to die for! Also, it is pretty thick in material, and you can tell it is very durable. Love the cut, it really is suited for every body type. I'm a size 8, 34 D, with decent sized bum. Absolutely love this peice. Will be saving up for the bikini top next!"
485,"Love this one piece! Really sexy and flattering, shipped quick and the owner is so helpful with choosing the right size! (This is my second one piece also, I originally bought a black one a year ago and loved it so much I got another!)"
486,"I LOVE The Cheeky Bikini. I bought this one piece in red, it's very well made and flatters a woman's body in all the right places!  Erin was so helpful in choosing a size and stayed in contact with me throughout the process, to make sure I received the bathing suit and that it was the right size. I would highly recommend The Cheeky Bikini to anyone. I will definitely be buying more in the future and cannot wait to hit the beach with my new one piece. 

Thank you Erin, for making a one piece that's so flattering and perfect!"
487,"I previously purchased the mid rise bottoms and loved them so much I decided to purchase the one piece. I had some hesitation because of the low cuts but all has been put to rest.  The suit makes me feel confident, sexy and it's super comfortable. Very well made. You will not be disappointed with your purchase of this or any item made by Erin."
488,"The name of this says it all: SO. FLATTERING.  I'm not a tiny girl, but I know I'm going to still feel very comfortable in this piece on the beach.  Just the right amount of ass with some tasteful side boob!  Great purchase."
489,Love love love my one piece in flamingo! Quality is outstanding and the customer service is amazing! Shipping was exactly as estimated and worth any sort of wait. Can not wait to order some bikinis next 😊
490,"Best bikini ever ! I was nervous about ordering online without trying first, but tired of going to numerous stores and never finding my perfect fit (38DDD). This was such a great buy !! Medium rise bottom and one piece swimsuit are genius too. Erin is also a pleasure to deal with. Will get more bikinis for sure !"
491,This my second one piece and I love it just as much as the first. I was skeptical of the pattern on me but After talking to Erin I decided to go for and what a great choice it was. Can’t wait to be able to wear.
492,"Honestly, how does this fit so well!? Very well made, double-layered, no internal brand or size tags to scratch your skin, and the red has a real Baywatch vibe. Really happy with it. Am 5'3, 115lbs and the small is perfect. Also came with a wet bag to store suit after your wear it. Can't wait for the high waisted cheekies to come out."
493,LOVE these bathing suits! I now how two and am thinking about the next color I want. I am full figured and feel so sexy in this suit. 100% recommended!
494,LOVE this one piece! It's flattering and made extremely well. The army green is gorgeous!! Very happy with this purchase and will probably purchase another color in the future.
495,"Have been looking for a cute one-piece for a while, and preferably to support a Canadian supplier. Not only was Erin super fast about confirming size and getting it shipped out, the product was exactly as described when it arrived. 

An affordable, high quality product and very happy! Another purchaser noted the red was very Baywatch colour so I went for it - spot on!"
496,LOVE THIS SUIT!
497,"I love my one piece! Erin was so helpful in making sure I had the right size and my order came so quick even though she said she was backed up after Black Friday sales. It is so comfortable, and even a bit sexy :)"
498,Fits & feels amazing! Love it!
499,The suit is great. I wanted a one piece I could wear under shorts and this fit the bill. I have a longer than average torso for my height. With the L it was a little short in length at first - I could feel it in the shoulders but it started to stretch. I think it has a little more room to stretch and it will be even better.
500,"Amazing as always! Love my dusty rose one piece, so flattering!"
501,I have this in 2 colours and I love it! Fit and quality is amazing!
502,"My new favorite swimsuit, fits perfectly and color is great!"
503,"She had one already made so I got mine super quick! This is one great looking one piece, as always the fabric feels very good quality! One thing though I’m very small chested so I wish it had built in cups, I sewed in my own cups. Also I’m pretty tall so there’s a small amount of camel toe happening but I’m confident that when it stretches out a bit this won’t be a problem, and probably wouldn’t be a problem with a darker colour."
504,"Easily the best customer service I've ever received on Etsy. From the beginning, Erin was wonderful to work with. After shipment, she wrote to ensure that the fitting was perfect and offered suggestions if it wasn't. The suit is high quality and amazingly flattering. Don't think twice - place your order!"
505,This is hands down THE BEST bathing suit ever!!!! It's so flattering and comfortable. I want one in every colour! Thanks Erin <3
506,"You are an absolute rockstar! Loving my new bathing suits, can't wait for it to finally not rain one weekend in NY so I can wear them!"
507,"Love this suit! Just like I read in other reviews, flattering in all the right places. Erin was so helpful and sells such a quality product. Would gladly order another!"
508,The seller is always so helpful with every purchase! The products are always just as described (even better!)
509,The best bathing suit I've ever owned. Quality!
510,I love the bathing suit. I just wish it was a little long since I have a longe torso. My boobs are basically out on top since the bathing suit isn’t made my my body type
511,"I am in LOVE with this bikini! It fits perfectly, and the style of it is very flattering. I ordered it in copper, and the color was accurate to the picture. Being a lifeguard and swimmer, comfort and practicality are a big thing when it comes to swimsuits. This bikini is very comfortable and I don't feel like I need to worry about adjusting it. 
Another big plus is that it didn't take long to get to me as I was expecting- took about 5 days ( I live in CA).
Overall, I am very very pleased with my order and will definitely be buying more colors in this suit as well as other products from this shop! :)"
512,color is gorgeous! love it
513,"Beautiful bikini set, fast shipping, great communication, true to description and size. Thank you fits perfectly 🌻"
514,Perfect fit! Super stretchy and comfortable. I’m 5’3 and a size 4-6 and I got a medium
515,I enjoyed making a top for my niece with this pattern and it turned out well.  There were a couple things that would have made the pattern a little easier to follow but it was still good and fairly easy to do. My niece loves the top!
516,Very full instructions come with this pattern super impressed with how easy it is to follow thanks to all the pictures :)
517,"I liked it so much that I had to make it immediately!  Easy to follow, came out beautifully."
518,It turned out really pretty!
519,It is a beautiful halter & I can't wait to make it. The pattern detail is 60+ pages so not reasonable to print and the chart is difficult to read so I think I'll write it out for myself but it is worth the work for what I anticipate will be something I make more than one of!  Thank you
520,"Very nice pattern, could maybe be a bit more details from row 12 and to the finish, but anyway very easy, even for an Norwegian girl 👍😊"
521,"i tried doing this and it turned out horrible. I had to first write out the pattern witch took me a good 4 hours. then the next day I tried to do it and before I even got past the chain part I notes that it was way to big to be a small or even a medium. so I only did 73 instead on 104. after that I tried to make it work, when I got to row 19 it was already at my neck. so I had to re due it. after trying to make it work and doing my own adjustments after three times it just kept being to wide in the middle and to long. so I ended up just making my own top with one pineapple than three. i'm disappointed these weren't written out in the first place and only a picture of lines and x's. it doesn't mention this in the description. at least I know what i'm doing and was able to make it my own. unfortunately I lost $5."
522,"GREAT PATTERN!!!  SUPER EASY TO FOLLOW,AND VERY DETAILED"
523,awesome!!! love this pattern!  very detailed and perfect for a new learner!
524,I love the pattern and the way it is shown in print and with photos.
525,Really beautiful top but the pattern isn't very well written. Quite confusing and isn't complete in certain rows.
526,Great pattern. Easy to follow. I love it.
527,Great Pattern Easy work up!!
528,Very Nice and detailed pattern!!
529,"At first look thought this was impossible to read, however once I started the translation was fine, and the pictures really helped. Is turning out lovely"
530,"Excelente patrón, muy fácil de seguir y con muchas fotos de todo el proceso, seguro volveré a comprar"
531,"Pattern looks great, it's a little tough to read, but i love it."
532,Lovely pattern. Easy to follow.
533,"The written pattern is a little difficult to follow, however the detailed pictures and diagram make it easy to figure out. Can't wait to finish this project!"
534,"Great pattern, also for beginners!"
535,Very detailed pattern with a lot of pictures.
536,Nice pattern!  Looking forward to making it!
537,very detailed! can't wait for my thread to arrive to start!
538,"Shipping went fine, but pattern wasn(t written so good"
539,"Not a full pattern - there's about 12 of the rows written out (sort of written out, doesn't tell you where to put stitches just how many of them there are) and then you basically have to work off of 2 half drawings, one with the row numbers that is badly drawn, one that is sort of better drawn but with no row numbers. All in all this is very hard to follow and you'd almost be better off trying to figure out the pattern from the picture rather than buying it."
540,Nice can wait to make it !
541,"Very poorly written and I did it twice, by pics and diagram still didn't come out the same way..."
542,They responded really quick and the instructions are easy to follow
543,Great service deliver very fast
544,"There is a full diagram but not a written pattern partial written to page 12! Then literally bits and pieces waste of time! I'm so disappointed because it's really very nice! May be good for some, but the reason for the one star is because I feel that the owner should have been a bit more honest in the item description! I guess I lost out on $5 bucks sorry not happy!"
545,I absolutely love my custom made crochet bikini!  I had wanted a special suit to bring with me on a series of celebratory vacations and Sveta worked with me to create something that's both beautiful and comfortable!  I can't wait to flaunt it!
546,"I love love love the bikini she made me. It fits perfectly and she made it so fast! The shipping took a lot longer than expected but arrived JUST on time. She was also so pleasant to buy from. Anyone questioning this purchase, please buy it's beautifully made! 5 thumbs up :)"
547,"WOW, simply wow! I am completely and utterly in love with my swimsuit. It fits like a charm, Svitlana was very helpful when it came to figuring out what would work best for me. The result is divine, the craftsmanship is spot on! I will definitely be back! Thank you very much for such a lovely piece, it makes me feel so beautiful when I wear it!"
548,"It took some time to receive it, but it was well worth the wait. It's absolutely beautifully made and the seller was very friendly and helpful. The only minus is that the bottom is a bit loose, but it's still worth five stars!"
549,I love this bikini! It took a while to arrive in London but it was well worth the wait. Thank you!
550,I love this item. It looks ever so delicate and fits perfectly. Creaspir was so nice and accommodated to my shipping request. She rushed to get it to me and was SUPER kind about it. I love my item and want to thank Creaspir so much for her kindness.
551,"Totally happy with both bikinis they suit perfectly and are unik . 
I also could not be happier with the shop owner . Fast shipping plus she is  super nice and obliging . :) 
All thumbes up !!"
552,"Thank you so much, what a beautiful bikini! It's such a flattering fit and so well made, you have a real talent. Would definitely recommend!"
553,"Took a little time to arrive but definitely worth it. Nicely wrapped and carefully made. Just check what size you are buying, the small is definitely small!"
554,Beautifully crafted. The color was a stunning red and the fit was great. The fabric was stretchy so it conformed nicely to my body. Thank you so much!
555,It's perfect!  I love it-  Thank you so much!
556,"I got a black one AND a white one, they are so cute!! Excellent craftsmanship and customer service, I am so thrilled with my purchases! Thank you 😊"
557,Absolutely beautifully made bikini. It arrived earlier than expected too! It fits perfectly and I can really see the workmanship put in to making it. I can't wait to show it off this summer!
558,"Even better than expected.  Fits amazing,  looks even better.  Already debating my next order!  Thank you!!"
559,"Amazing work…! Beautiful piece of art, perfectly mad, shipped on time, excellent interaction. Bought 2 bikinis and both are just gorgeous! Can only recommend buying it!"
560,It is absolutely gorgeous and so comfortable! Arrived fast for being hand-made too!
561,its great but I need to add a liner to the bottom half when it gets wet you can see things!! other then that its great  and I think when I order  next year ill get 2
562,Beautifully made and even custom request alterations made. And again the packaging was precious (I am a repeat customer for a reason). Thank you - still sending prayers for Ukraine.
563,I love this so much! Thank you!!! :) :)
564,my new favorite bikini!!!!!!!! absolutely love it and the color is so pretty :D

588,The wife loved it.  It fit her perfect.  Amazing artist work
589,"There are no words for how perfect this bikini is. My reasons for purchasing were mostly sentimental. I had a little pink crocheted bikini when I was a teenager and I wore it to death, until it came to its end in an unfortunate fire. (True story!) For many years since, I have missed that little pink bikini and wished for another like it. Thank god for Svitlana, who made me one far better even than the one I remember having when I was younger. 
n
nHer craftsmanship is really superior, and she responded very quickly when I emailed her to inquire about my order. (I was eager, I admit it!) I received my order quickly, despite international shipping, and I am so, so in love with this item. It is a definite WOW. Can't wait to wear it to the beach and will definitely be ordering again in the future."
590,Beautifully made! Good service and fast shipping :-)
591,Absolutely gorgeous bikini!! Can't wait to wear it on my hols. Would definitely recommend :)
592,"Beautiful bikini, exceptional craftsmanship thank you!"
593,"Beautiful packaging, fast shipping and absolutely beautiful work!"
594,Wonderful service! Suit is cute bohemian and fun to wear!
595,This item was beautifully made.  Loved it :)
596,"My sister in law says her custom cream bikini is the sexiest thing she's ever put on, and fits perfectly."
597,Very nice quality.
598,"Fast email answers, fast shipping, great bikini, great seller!"
599,"I am so happy with this piece, Laura took extra time and care to get it to me as we had difficulty with the shipping. The whole experience was pleasant and I love that I get to wear all these frutas."
600,"This swimsuit is beautiful, fits great, and the fabric is so comfortable!  Dries quickly.  The best part of this purchase was the fantastic service by The Seller.  She went out of her way to make me happy!"
601,The swuimsuit it's perfect and I love it. Laura was so kind and helpful! Sure i'll buy again her lovely sweaters on winter!
602,I love it - it's perfect!! :-)
603,"This bathing suit is AMAZING! The colors are bold and bright, quality incredibly high and of course, very kind seller. Unfortunately the bathing did not fit me. But I would order from seller again based off of great customer service and beautiful products. Thank you again!!!"
604,"I debated a long time over getting this swimsuit because I'm always so nervous when it comes to buying swimwear before I get a chance to try it on. But the fit is great, granted I don't have the biggest butt or chest. I can't wait to wear it on my vacation next week. Got here just in time, too!"
605,"Shipped easily and quickly to the US, and the fabric is really high quality. The colors are just as vivid in person! It's quickly becoming my favorite suit."
606,Love it! Can't wait to go to the beach!
607,"Very nice design, lovely cloths! 
i love them!"
608,Beautiful. Very well made. Extremely comfortable and quite flattering. Thank you so much!
609,Super cute and a great cut but definitely see though. Wish it had a thicker peach/flesh lining instead of a white one
610,"Really sweet graphics on this suit! Shipped quickly, all as described! Thanks!"
611,This looks great! I can't wait to wear it.
612,I need some sort of bra to wear under the swimsuit.  Bad fit at the moment.
613,Wow wow wow wow wow
614,"Not a lot of string so it's kind of hard to tie and it's not stretchy material, but I made it work. That's for the top. The bottoms are  SO small and don't stretch so I had to throw them away. Okay but not worth the price."
615,Very nice thank you. TC
616,Ordered an xl and got a small .. then I email the company and never got a response
617,"I ordered the camo and the red lace. Both are beautiful and well made. I was not sure about the sizing since I can wear anything from a small to a large depending on the brand, so I had to size up in the top and down in the bottoms. BonnyBikini helped me with sizing and made the exchange process a breeze! I'll be ordering from here again!"
618,The colors are just stunning. The coral just pops in color! This is amazing cant wait for summer.
619,"Just got my very first Bonny Bikini order today and I’m in LOVE!! The quality is amazing; the material is so soft and comfy and very well made.  The sizing is absolutely accurate which is awesome! I love knowing that my next order will fit just as it should. I’m in love with the pop of bright peach with the camo, and I love that my bikini will be unique in a crowd this summer! I couldn’t be happier! 🧡💚🖤"
620,I absolutely LOVE this swimsuit! Seller was extremely helpful and super quick to respond to any and all of my questions! Very quick turnaround time! Will definitely be ordering more 🙂
621,She loved it. She is DD on top and a Med on bottom. It was perfect. TY.
622,I’m going to order like a million more suits from you! I love it! Bonny helped me pick the right size with quick responses and got my suit in about a week. Love it!
623,Got so many compliments on this. I had also ordered the wrong size bottoms and they were so awesome about exchanging it for me!
624,Orange and camo is the perfect combo for this! Fits perfectly! I love this shop!!
625,One of my new favs!!!!
626,love this bikini!! its fits super nice and the colors are vibrant

636,great fit girlfriend loves it
637,great productos and great customer services
638,"This thing is awesome. As my first time ordering a handmade bathing suit, let me just say I was a little worried about coming unraveled. This thing is very well made. Tight- as in the weave- it's not coming apart. The top around the back ties a little different than what I'm used to- and I mean that in a good way. It's different and very cool. I don't have a single bad thing to say about this bikini! For the Americans- I ordered the moderate bottom coverage & the cut is just barely smaller than what we are accustomed to. It looks great, fits great... Now I just have to stare at it until I can wear it when it's warm😻😻😻"
639,By far one of the very best made bathing suits I have ever had. So gorgeous and looks exactly like the picture! Super fast shipping too!
640,"It's so lovely and sexy crochet bikini
what I ordered! 
I just measured my exact size and she
made them for me that was so amazing!
Also I requested my favorite color
then she accepted it!
Thank you for your everything and I received them on time !
Can't wait to go to Hawaii with them.
Your job is great,Fabiana!!!"
641,"Fits exactly as I imagined! Great quality bikini from a seller that I would buy from again. I'm in love 😍 seller shipped on a timely fashion however it took almost a month to receive. Customs had the package for a little over a week, not the sellers fault just be aware if you live in the U.S."
642,"The swimsuit is as pictured and very cute! Customer service is great as well! The top was a little too small, but Fabiana let me exchange it for a larger one. I can't wait to wear it!"
643,"Received it after Covid chaos! ABSOLUTELY THE MOST BEAUTIFULLY CROTCHED ITEM I HAVE EVER PURCHASED!!! COLOR, CUT, STYLE SPOT ON!!!👍"
644,Absolutely exceeded my expectations. Love it (: I will be back for more !!!!
645,So cute! Love it. Bottoms run on the smaller side. Great quality.
646,So beautiful! Great quality and stretchy. I am ready to rock this in Aruba on my honeymoon! ☀️❤️🙌
647,Love it! It's so cute and literally fits perfectly!
648,Thank you so much for getting this right out for me! The bikini is absolutely gorgeous and fits like a glove!
649,Fits perfectly and is every bit of amazing as promised. Worth the buy!
650,Very well made and absolutely gorgeous. So flattering!!!
651,Beautiful and fits perfectly!
652,"Misure perfette 
Puntualità di arrivo merce
Complimenti"
653,Prendre une taille de plus mais bien conçu.
654,Didnt ship on time and haven't received it at all after waiting for almost 8 weeks. Thanks for Etsy i got my refund back cause the owner stopped replying !
655,Beautiful swimsuit. However I'm disappointed with the fit. I have fake boobs and they are wide set on my chest. The top feels as though my boobs are falling out the sides. The shop owner says as you wear it it conforms to your body so I will try however I am sad it doesn't seem to fit quite right. It may just be my body shape due to wide set boobs.
656,Love this!
657,Love the colors! It's a perfect summer top!
658,sehr schön und sehr schnell versendet. Vielen Dank!
659,Beautiful. Can't wait to wear it. Shipped on time.
660,"I am a mom who is self-conscious about my body, she communicated back and forth with me, was understanding, and I feel like I have a custom-made suit! It’s perfect for 4th of July or anytime! It fits great and she gave me extra support in my chest area- she’s a mom, too, and helped me be confident to go to the beach and everywhere with the boys this summer. It’s a beautiful suit and it was packaged nicely and arrived in perfect time, I also loved my sweet note! Thank you so much! Can’t wait to support her again!"
661,"My daughter found this suit for spring break.  (Very much Team Cap for the upcoming Captain America: Civil War movie).  I did my best to measure correctly and added her clothing sizes for the seller, and what my daughter got was a perfectly made swimsuit that is SO her style!  The only thing that could have made this purchase better would be if there were some type of coordinating beach cover-up available.  😆  We are THRILLED with this swimsuit!  Purchase to delivery was very fast, too, and the pretty pink bubble package added to the excitement and anticipation of digging in.  If you ever make a Bucky or Loki version, let us know and we'll make another purchase for sure!"
662,"I ordered this suit for my 13 year old daughter who loves Captain America.  I loved how old-fashioned and modest the suit was.  I sent her size, height and measurements in and the suit fits like a dream!  She looks adorable in it and is very happy with it, as am I."
663,Gorgeous work! I could not be happier! I am finally wearing a bathing suit again! LOVE LOVE LOVE
664,"After purchasing swimsuits from 2 other handmade swimsuit shops here on ETSY, I had to revise my feedback. This is the best seller, hands down. It fits! Beautifully! Even without an underwire! This is the only suit I ordered that I will actually wear and I included my measurements to all 3 shops! It looks amazing. I love it and am so glad I made this purchase. If your on the fence, buy it. YOU WONT REGRET IT!  I will only buy suits here from now on ."
665,"I'm so in love with this swimsuit. When I saw it was delivered I rushed home to try it on, it looks just amazing and fits like a glove. This was an instabuy and would buy again in a heartbeat. Great quality & thanks for a swimsuit that I feel confident (and nerdy) wearing!"
666,"Oh my goodness!!! This item is perfect in every way. It fits amazingly, looks amazing and makes me feel amazing. I would give it 10 stars if I could."
667,"Fit like a glove and looks awesome!! It's very high-quality: substantial material without feeling bulky. I've gained weight recently and I didn't want to wear a bikini, so I got this for 4th of July haha :) I can't wait to wear it!! (I haven't worn it in water yet but I have no worries about it!)"
668,Fast shipping and fantastic quality. I have a very dramatic pear shape and the seller worked with me to make me a fit that was right for me. Fits like a glove and I love it!
669,"The Captain America swimsuit is FABULOUS! It looks fantastic & it's super comfortable. It's even slimming! I'm so happy it arrived so quickly (in time for my vacation!) and it's definitely my favorite swimsuit I've ever bought. Super, super awesome!!"
670,"I received this item very quickly and in wonderful condition. it is so beautiful and fits amazing. I cant wait to wear it in the summer, my only regret is that I didn't find this item before I went on my Hawaiian vacation last year I would have loved to wear this. Thank you."
671,I absolutely love this suit! It was shipped out so quickly and was the perfect bathing suit to wear on my vacation to the beach!
672,"I honestly don't know if I have ever been more happy with a purchase in my life. It's beautiful, it's flattering, it's extremely well made and arrived so quickly. I can;t wait to buy so many more things from this shop ;)"
673,"This is a great swimsuit. I've worn it in a chlorinated pool for a few months now and the colors aren't affected. The seller works fast, too."

675,"Love, love, love the bathing suit!!! Quality made. Fits perfect!"

679,This swimsuit is amazing! And I got it in no time! I cannot wait for my cruise so I can be the nerdiest one at the pool. Thank you so much! I adore it!
680,It is beautiful!  High quality work from an amazing seller.  I sent a request for a custom suit as well and she quickly drafted up a beautiful design.  I love it!
681,"This suit is absolutely amazing. It arrived SO quickly, and the quality is top notch. It looks and feels fantastic."
682,It was shipped here faster than I expected and the quality is great! It's a perfect fit too! Will definitely buy from this shop again!!

689,Super cutie! Absolutely love it!

693,Has good support for a halter suit and is comfortable to wear. I love it!!
694,"It's the best fitting one piece I've had in my life, and it shipped so quick! I love it!"
695,"Nicely packaged, quality material, and fit great! Happy with my purchase and Christy included a hand written thank you note that I thought was nice."
696,Perfect fit and amazing communication to make sure it got that way.  Thanks so much!
697,My wife loves it! High quality and level of craftsmanship. Shipped and received quickly.
698,"This swimsuit arrived blazingly fast and is incredibly well-made. I emailed the shop owner beforehand to ask what size to buy, and she advised promptly (and it fit perfectly when I got it). I highly recommend this shop for all your swimming needs! :)"
699,Arrived very quickly. Fits very well and is absolutely gorgeous!
700,Fantastic swimsuit which came quickly!  Thank you!!
701,Suit is exactly as described and the fit is great!
702,Super fast delivery and wonderful suit!
703,"I absolutely love it!! My only disappointment is the top is a bit small  I send measurements , maybe I just didn't measure right 😩
Still love and is exactly what I imagined / I guess if I pop out .. I pop out lol
Thank u!"
704,"this bathing suit is beautifully made. beautiful stitching. looks delicately and carefully made. the front on the bottoms is a little wide, but it's not that bad. the top doesn't have an underwire, just elastic. bathing suit looks great on. shipping time was as expected. took 2.5 weeks from Greece to USA. definitely recommend !!"
705,"I ordered this swim suit in cream, and size 34C top. I absolutely LOVE it. It's beautifully made, wonderful quality, and fits me perfectly. I've even worn the top as a shirt a few times!"
706,I love it! It's perfect.
707,"The fit is great and the material used is very soft and comfortable. Said it would take 14-18 days to ship to Canada, and it took 18 days which I was happy with!"
708,"Awesome, awesome, awesome!!  Love the color and the fit!!  Thank you so much!!"
709,"Fits perfectly, shipped faster than I expected for a handmade item, and the quality is stunning."
710,"Great quality,  but shipping definitely took its time to get to Ontario. Love the product though!"
711,"I love this bikini. It is great work!
And it was shipped very fast.
I would definitely buy at your shop again! 

Thank you"
712,"Great item,very well done.the size are very precise.Thank you!"
713,Amazing! Fits perfectly!!!! More than satisfied
714,I LOVE IT! Super cute and comfortable
715,Fit like a glove!!!
716,received and fits amazing thanks so very much my husband loves it on me!!!
717,"Very pretty but there's no support for the top. My breasts hang out the bottom. I'm having my aunt sew in some elastic string so it will actually hold me in place.  I don't know how else I would be able to wear it in public. The bottoms are minimal coverage also, so be aware.  Shop owner is very nice and communicates well though if you wanted to shop her other products"
718,"Très beau maillot et bonne qualité, le rendu est super !"
719,"It shipped on time, and it is made so beautifully!"
720,"Lovely bikini, very well made. Thank you!!"
721,"The product arrived in a totally different color than I expected. On the description, it says ""cream"", which I assumed to be white/cream color, but in reality it is a light pink/nude color, which is kind of weird color. The swimming suit doesn't hold after wash. So quite disappointing. I wouldn't recommend it."
722,"Very lovely bikini but no support and after a couple wears it got very loose, the colour is more a pinky nude as well"
723,"Pros:
Fitment is great! Seam reinforcement isn't too busy and just right in all the right places.
Cons: Nobody warned me I would want to wear it all the time!!!"
724,"Incredible item, fit perfectly and the customizations were worth a lot. High quality and beautiful material. It took 2 months to arrive, could have arrived earlier, but my country's correspondence is not efficient. We are very happy with the products we order and fully recommend. The purchase process with BrightAndShinyLatex was very uncomplicated

In short, no problem, no inconvenience only happiness.
Thanks for the great product I hope to buy more soon."
725,The one piece was amazing and looked great once washed and shined.
726,"The swimsuit is very well built. The top of the neck is reinforced with a second layer of latex. The material feels nice and thick. The struggle to get inside it through the neck opening is quite exciting and also the feeling of being stuck inside it when you try to get out of it. I will recommend it to my friends.

The build and shipping time were about 5 weeks which is ok for me."
727,Love it so much ! The size is Perfect ! Thx
728,Obsessed! Beyond sexy and very flattering. It's also great quality for the price. Already placed another order! 😈🖤💋
729,"Great suit for a really good price!

The 0.4 mm latex is durable and sturdy; no problem entering by stretching the neck. 

Will definitely buy again!"
730,"Suit is beautiful, perfectly fit.
love it."
731,I latex appeared more transparent in the picture but very nice quality.
732,Amazing. Great high quality - fits perfect!!
733,"Perfect, very Nice seller, you can buy eyes closed, best quality and best prices. !"
734,great latex product well made. had a customization to it and seller was extremely accommodating and easy to work with.
735,"Wonderful 🖤
Thank you 🌹"
736,Love it! Well made. Exactly what I was looking for.
737,Lovely! Thanks for the special order without the high neck;-)
738,"Very well made, fits great."
739,"ordered with back and crotch zipper, good quality so far, fits perfectly, girlfriend loves it and although she likes latex she usually finds it uncomfortable but not this, would definitely buy again from this seller"
740,Its sqeezing at the private parts after wearing it at casual days when you go shopping. Other then that it is well made and fits good. My husband is in love with it and it can be worn instead of casual underwear.
741,La taille est parfaite mais il est extremement difficile de l'enfiler par le haut.
742,"I got it fairly quickly after I ordered it. I tried it on to make sure it fit and everything, however when the first time that I put it on to actually use it the seam split and went down the arm. I'm really not to impressed with the quality of the product. They said I could send it back and pay to have it fixed but I don't want to spend more money to have it fixed and not be sure that it won't happen again. Overall it fit like it should, I'm just disappointed in the quality."
743,"love love LOVE this new sharkini!  It's positively adorable and kinda sexy, HAHA.  As a shark-lover, this outfit is awesome.  the only issue I have with this is the chain strap in attempt to put it on--it's a bit difficult, but I can work around it.  Thank you again! :)"
744,perfect fit 🖤
745,"My first package must have gotten lost in the mail so I notified Lizz & she re-shipped my order the very next day! I received it within the next few days! I love the shark monokini and it actually fit better than I expected! I also had two little unexpected surprises in the package, a charm and a bracelet. Thank you so much Lizz! You have been wonderful! I HIGHLY recommended ordering from her! 🤗"
746,"I got both the Aqua (in XS) and the strapless Gray (in S) because I've always wanted one of these and those were the closest to my size in stock.

Because sizing and stock were limited, the fits aren't PERFECT, but I still feel cute in them. Preferably I would have loved to get a custom one, but the pre set sizing wasn't bad. (Just a little bit odd for my body.)

I ended up taking out the padding in the bust of the Aqua suit because it didn't work well with my bust. The pads just wouldn't sit where I needed them. It didn't really cause a problem, if you don't have piercings your nips should be discreet!

The chain strap on the Aqua suit did start rusting after exposure to salt water, so keep that in mind if you're using this for beach wear!

Additionally, the Gray Strapless one gave both me and another person camel toe. :("
747,Daughter wore this in a surf halloween contest and looked amazing!  Got so many compliments!  Suit is very well made and held up perfectly after getting tossed in waves.  Received it very quickly.  Wonderful experience!
748,"Amazing seller! I had to exchange for a different size and she did it right away so I would get it in time for a Halloween party! Great suit and quality as well! Not cheap material or design, very well made! Thanks again!"
749,LOVE everything about the Sharkini bathing suit. I purchased one from a different shop for more than 2x the price and less than 1/2 the quality as this one. I am so excited to show it off during the summer. Thank you so much!
750,This item was absolutley perfect for Halloween! It fit perfectly and I recieved so many compliments on it!! It came so fast in the mail as well. I strongly encourage buying her items! I would 100% again!
751,"I positively love this suit! I'm a D cup, so I wasn't sure if this would work for me, but it offers plenty of support and coverage. I can't wait to show it off to my friends on our kayaking trip this weekend!"
752,love my sharkini! I just took it with me on my honeymoon and got so many laughs and compliments. thanks!
753,"Well made! Love the padding inserts to keep everything covered. I am 5’6” with a 25” waist, 32” chest, and 35” hips. The small fit fine, but I’m sure I could have sized up for length and everything would have still been great. Adorable suit!"
754,I absolutely love this bathing suit I'm usually a small but I ordered a medium because that's what the size chart said to go with if it helps I'm 5'6 I weigh 100 pounds and I'm a 32b and a medium fits perfect... this was a great purchase I'll deffenitly be shopping from here again
755,Loved the suit! Fit perfectly if not better than what I expected :)
756,"Loved this swimsuit for the baby shark themed pool party!!! Fits great!! Great quality, great buy!!"
757,"I absolutely LOVE the grey sharkini with the gold chain! While I must admit it takes an advanced degree to get into the sharkini, once IN - it makes me and everyone around me smile because it is wonderfully original and fabulously unique. 

An added bonus...the seller is a great communicator. Two thumbs way up!!!"
758,"I love the way it looks, a little small but because I had to guess my size 😁 but I love it"
759,"Sehr Freundlicher Kontakt, schnelle Lieferung. Artikel in einwandfreiem Zustand und sauber verarbeitet! Alles super!"
760,"Just received my sharkini this morning. Very happy of it. So chic and eccentric at the same time.
Thank you ButterMakesMeHappy."
761,"The suit looks amazing! It fits perfectly and is just like I was told! I have gotten complements on how cute it is! Defiantly a great suit for a great price! 
Thank you for my Sharkini!"
762,"This seller is amazing!!!  Excellent communication, super fast delivery and my daughter loved her suit!!!  Can’t wait to do business with again!  Thank you!!"
763,"Fits really well and is super cute! Also the suit is made very well with a good liner and quality materials. Love the chain accent on it too, a great find :)"
764,"Seller is super helpful, hands on and efficient. This product is so cute and looks great! It's a little hard to put on at first by nature of the design. Definitely happy I bought this!"
765,It's so cute! I love it. The fit is good.
766,Love my bathing suit! I ordered a Medium and it fit perfect! Shipped very fast and its great quality. Would definitely recommend!
767,Love this swimsuit! A little tight in the top but overall it fit well.
768,"First, the seller is so incredibly patient as I messed up my address not once, but twice!!!  She was very helpful.  I received my swimsuit yesterday and LOVE it, it is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you for such a great experience and product :)."
769,So cute on! It fits really well and is made well! Thank you so much!
770,Great experience with this shop. I've been wanting a sharkini forever and this shop was the BEST price and I couldn't be more pleased with the shop. My order arrived quickly and was packaged so great! I will be happy to buy from them again!!!
771,I love it so much!!! My body's shaped a bit too odd for it though :/ I will be back to try to purchase again!
772,Great bathing suit! Super cute. Sadly didn't fit.
773,I cannot begin to count the number of compliments I've received on this suit!!! Absolutely LOVE it!!
774,I love my new swimsuits very cute ^-^
775,Suit is perfect and well done. Unfortunately it was too small. Should've bought Medium size. Great seller :)
776,"This bathing suit is awesome!! Seller is very friendly, quick to respond and goes above and beyond! I would definitely recommend this shop! Very, very happy with my experience and purchase!"
777,Fits exactly just how I expected and I love it!
778,"Amazing quality and wonderful communication! The first one I ordered didn't fit, and the seller was quick to reply and send me another size. Would definitely buy from again!!"
779,"Very cute design and idea, returning product due to seams coming apart but had very good experience with customer service."
780,"This item is hilarious and well made. I requested quick shipping for a vacation and it arrived over a week early. 

Liz was nice and professional."
781,"Cannot wait to wear this on spring break! The ""teeth"" are kind of flimsy but I think they'll be alright once it's gotten on the water and can dry flat!"
782,"Super cute! True to size, great material, and wonderful craftsmanship!"
783,"Awesome seller!  Hope to do business with this shop again.  Thank you so much,  I love the swimsuit."
784,Although I did not end up completing my purchase due to a change of plans on my end Buttermakesmehappy was extremely fast answering all my questions (always responded within literally minutes-love that) and was able to make even a cancellation such an easy transaction! Super accommodating! I would definitely purchase from in the future
785,Preeetty awesome :) and it has pretty good coverage
786,I love the swimsuit. It got to me in time for vacation. The seller is very nice.
787,"I bought both the Aqua (in XS) and the Gray Strapless(in S)! I left a more detailed review of the Aqua already, so here's a note on the Strapless Gray:

The bottom fits odd. I'm not sure if this is a sizing issue from me buying the wrong size or if it's just that the cut is unflattering on both me and my wife (who also tried it on). It gives both of us either camel toe or a very obvious pubic area.

Also, yes there is no padding, like advertised. Most nipples won't have a problem unless they have jewelry in them. 

That aside, the suit is darling. 

Also, shipping was very fast and I was pleasantly surprised that even with my horrible time management skills I was able to get both suits before I left for vacation!"
788,Very tight fit. Order a size up if you can.
789,I like it but I needed the strap one unless I want my top to fall off. Good product but I need more boobs to hold the top up.
790,Item was perfect!  Just as described and soooo fun!
791,Cute suit and fit is perfect! Shipped quickly and on time!
792,"Seller communicates quickly and positively, thank you."
793,"The suit is ridiculously impossible to put on :( while it might barely stretch to the full width described, you have to put the top piece on and then do acrobatics to get into the bottoms. Just not what I was expecting at all. Plus the fit is very tight and not exactly flattering."
794,"Nice, unique design.  There was a delay by USPS but the seller took care of it."
795,"Very pretty, looks like the picture, great deal."
796,Shipped on time & quality product
797,"Great, fun buy and a smooth transaction."
798,Fits like a glove. So worth the wait and the money. I have trouble finding a well fitted one piece because of my height so having one made to fit my height is incredible. I will absolutely be ordering again. The quality and comfort is seriously like no other. Thank you for communicating so well and making such a beautiful one piece for me!!
799,Love it. Amazing fit. its requiring i post more words... it is my favorite suit.
800,My girlfriend loves this suit!  Cut and length are perfect and the material is great!  Highly recommended! And thank you for the hand written letter.
801,"I loved the swimsuit I received. The seat area was a little big, but it wasn't very noticeable. The color was amazing. I received so many compliments on the swimsuit. It was perfect for my trip to the Bahamas."
802,"I ordered this to be a little less cheeky and a little less high on the hips.  She followed my specifications exactly! Makes me feel sexy, but modest enough to do cartwheels on the beach. I loved having a piece made just for my body. Thank you Breezie."
803,"Fits like a dream, shows off my favorite body part (my butt lol)."
804,I fell in love with this suit & the vibrant color red! Great customer service and prompt on conversation replies.
805,"This swimsuit is amazing, great quality and so unique! Definitely worth the price. BreezieStardust has been wonderful to work with even going as far as letting me return the suit when it was too small and immediately shipping me a bigger one. Will definitely order again in the future!"
806,This swimsuit is exactly what I wanted! BreezieStardust is very responsive and really will custom make your order. When you have a big bust it's hard to find a swim suit that fits...just tell her your concerns and she's on it! I can't wait to wear this in Mexico!
807,Very flattering and custom made to my specifications.
808,The material was nice and thick and fit perfect!!!
809,Great fit with push up effect.
810,"She looks Awesome in this, GREAT job"
811,Great seller to work with. I was unhappy with how the bottoms fit  me and they fixed them for me. Perfect!! Thank you!!
812,"Perfect fit, ordered a small in top and bottom. Loved it ❤️"
813,I love love love this swim suit! The fit was absolutely perfect! I'm ordering another one this week. Shipping was prompt.
814,"The top needs more structure! It's just a piece of fabric when you move your body, even just a little, the top rolls! Will have to wear a different top but love the bottoms."
815,"good quality, too bad no padding"
816,Took some time to get to me but the prediction date for delivery was accurate. The seller is really great and I re omens corresponding with her right after you purchase to discuss sizing. The actual bathing suite is gorgeous! Well made. Looks just like the photo. Flattering on my top and bottom heavy body. I usually wear a size 6 or 8 in dresses and I got a medium. Fits great and I love the waist cinch the straps/ belt provide.
817,"This is the EXACT cut swimsuit I’ve been looking for. Has a lower cut on the leg to give it that vintage vibe, with a lower cut top so it’s not too modest. Add in the wrap around ties to accentuate your waist, and I’m in love! It’s well made, with strong stitching and quality fabric. The shop owner was very helpful with figuring out shipping and tracking. I’m so so so pleased with my purchase, and would absolutely buy again!"
818,"This suit is perfect! I wish more brands would make this style of one-piece suit, it is so beautiful and flattering. It has enough coverage to make me feel comfortable, yet the low back and v-neck are still very stylish. Love it!"
819,"My suit arrived exactly as pictured, and so beautiful. Wonderful quality and very flattering fit. I am 5'4, 115lbs and ordered the XS and it fits like a glove. The owner Eynat was extremely helpful and very responsive to several questions I had regarding fit before my purchase, and some I had after as well. I am sooo happy with my purchase and will definitely come to this shop for future purchases. The price point is above what I normally spend, and well worth it to me. This shop gets 5 stars for item quality, shipping time, and customer service, I couldn't ask for better in any category. Thank you Eynat! xoxoxo"
820,"Buy from this shop!  You will not regret it. Klipperswimsuits is the most responsive seller I've met to date on Etsy - Eynat was super communicative about the whole transaction. And the suit is AMAZING - nothing like what you would find at any department store.  The quality is exactly as pictured and more.  It fit perfect so sizing is precise.  Trying to decide if I can justify getting another. ;) And can't wait to see what Eynat does next with this new the new shop she is creating. Seriously, buy from this shop!!!!"
821,"Beautifully made swimsuit. None of my other pieces of swimwear compares to this piece. Seriously it is super beautiful, I recommend if you are between sizes to size down as it will stretch a little in the water."
822,The swimsuit is gorgeous and beautifully made. It shipped on time and arrived quickly. When I tried it on and it fit perfectly with the exception of being a little short in length. When I contacted the maker she is assured me that it will stretch and when I looked back at our notes I realize she had told me this would be exactly what would happen. I don’t get to use it for a couple of weeks but I’m really looking forward to it.
823,"Love this swimsuit and the way it looks on me. It's sturdy, stylish, and will get lots of use once summer arrives. Eynat was very kind and helpful with getting my correct sizing. I do find that my body is a little longer than the length of the suit; I'm sure, however, that the suit will stretch a bit lengthwise with consistent wear.

Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and will absolutely buy from this shop again. Thank you, Eynat!"
824,"Confortable, beau et de qualité, cette boutique a été une très belle découverte."
825,"Very nice swimsuit.
Material and shape are conform to the description"
826,Beautiful and very Well made
827,Beautiful quality and extremely flattering!
828,"Love this cap so much! I have really long, curly hair and I can wear it in a bun under this cap. The seal is extremely water tight, no more standing in a corner at the pool because I don't wanna get my bleached hair wet."
829,"The cap fits well without snagging my hair. I use it for biweekly deep conditioning treatments, and after a runs in cool soapy water it returns to its original shape. Once the weather warms I hope to be able to take it for a proper swim. :-)"
830,"It's absolutely perfect! I was skeptical at first because there was some space with air at the top when I put it on, but it kept my hair completely dry, even after repeated dives into the water! Extremely satisfied!!!"
831,"Love it, perfect for the type and amount of hair I have"
832,"This is perfect for long/thick/curly hair - just what I had been looking for and hadn't been able to find until I found this. Lovely design, great choice of colours and sizes (I bought a Large), great quality, and really well packaged and arrived quickly. Can't wait to use it. Many thanks."
833,"This was bought for my niece as she has a lot of hair, fits really well and keeps the hair a lot dryer than any standard cap - great product highly recommend!"
834,This swim cap works perfectly.
835,I have NEVER really enjoyed the freedom of swimming until now. Thanks for a really great and needed product.
836,I love it! I have very long and abbundant wavy hair. This is perfect. It goes in in seconds and does not break my hair.
837,Really great quality and super quick delivery unfortunately it was too large. Great customer service thank you
838,Exactly what I wanted.  Excellent hold.
839,Perfect for all my dreads. Smooth easy transaction and fast post - very happy - THANKS!
840,"Excellent, stopped me getting headaches from a tight cap when swimming."
841,"Great item and very quick communication with seller, thank you"
842,"I got my cap in a timely manner, but unfortunately, it was defective. The rubber was stuck together in the front of the cap."
843,I did NOT receive this item yet
844,I didn’t even get my item. It says it got delivered..but that’s wrong.
845,This is my 4th order from Julia. She is so amazing and the quality of the item is THE BEST you can buy. Even thou they are knitted they dry VERY fast and there is no sagging from weight. They fit perfect - top and bottom. I am somewhat in between sized so she was sweet enough to modify and add an extra stitch row to my tops. I highly recommend purchasing from Julia. I'll have these pieces for a long time. So many thanks- As always!!!!!! <3
846,"I bought this bikini for my upcoming honeymoon and I love it! After it was completed, the estimated shipping was 2-3 weeks and I received it (to the US) after only a week!! It is great quality, provides complete coverage, and is thick enough to ensure no wardrobe malfunctions. Julia was very responsive and kind, and worked with me to ensure she had my exact measurements. I literally want this bikini in every single color and would highly recommend Julia's shop!"
847,"great quality and sturdy shape!!  took forever and the color isn't really cream, it's more of a dirty yellow, but that's the price you pay picking a color via a computer screen.  seller was very nice and helpful."
848,"Beautiful job!!!💙💜🧡💛💚 she made it very well. Excellent quality, fit perfectly. 
I recommend it with Love💖"
849,I love the material used to make this crochet bikini! It is soft and has a little bit of stretch to make it comfortable. It DOES NOT sag/bulge when it gets wet. It stays right where it should and looks the same dry as wet. The craftsmanship is impeccable and I couldn't be more pleased with the fit! Julia is wonderfully pleasant to work with and very accommodating. I will definitely be ordering again!
850,Super cute!! Seller was super nice and product was good quality! Super excited to wear it to the beach!
851,"Julia work, is simple and elegant💕

A touch of brilliance,
Dawn"
852,"Great quality! I tried buying another crochet bikini top that was mass produced, but the material was thin and flimsy. It didn't have any shape.
This one, however, feels sturdier and the cups mold to my breast shape nicely.
I received it relatively quick (coming from Poland to the US). Even the packaging was done with care."
853,Fantastic quality. Will be back for more items.
854,Very well made and fits perfect'
855,I have never felt so beautiful in a swim suit before. 😍 The quality is great and the service was fantastic. Definitely coming back for more unique suits! Highly recommend.
856,"Fits perfect; Arrived very, very fast; It is very comfortable and looks great!  I'm extremely happy with this purchase and the shop."
857,Amazingly made. Seriously love this. The size fits perfect and the shipping was very quick. I will definitely be buying more from this shop.
858,"Beautifully made suit, AMAZING customer service. Thank you so much!!"
859,I'm so excited to wear this! I wanted to get a swimsuit that expressed my nerdiness and at last I have one <3
860,Love The item however it didn't arrive on time and I had to pay extra charges to receive it when it arrived in UK. When mentioned to seller I got no response which was deeply disappointing. Very bad experience won't be buying from seller again.
861,Cute! Can't wait to wear it
862,"I needed a skirt to fit over my wetsuit while surfing, Bethany was super accommodating making it slightly narrower so it doesn't fly up. It worked perfectly!!! Thanks!!"
863,"Ordered this for my mom and one for myself. My mom and I LOVE this swim skirt. We have looked at many over the years and ccould never afford the price tag of $60-150. This skirt is a great, handmade quality  skirt. We both wore it to a water park on our revent vacation to Florida, and we were finally able to swim and ride the slides, all while not having to worry about modesty! I even worremember mine to Disney parks and was extremely comfortable. I will be ordering several more of these to wear during the summer and for yard work."

865,"I got this skirt in the pattern #035 and requested it to be 16"" long. This fit me perfect! It was barely above the knee how I wanted it and it's super CUTE. I appreciate the speedy delivery as well. This product does not disappoint and I may possibly be buying a few more for my other family members since they saw it and loved it too! I can't wait to be modest this summer at the beach. Thank you so much!"
866,"I ordered a custom high waist swim skirt in black to wear over a one piece suit (that is a little too revealing for my taste).  Bethanie understood exactly what I wanted with only a short description and photo.  

She provided the perfect custom swim skirt! The fit and style was exactly what I wanted and Bethanie was fantastic to work with through the whole process!  Extremely fast production and shipping!  

I highly recommend this seller!  I will definitely be ordering another!

Thanks again Bethanie!"
867,"Perfect! The length was just right, I wanted it to just about cover the knee and loved that you had the custom option with different lengths."
868,"Perfect! The length was just right, I wanted it to just about cover the knee and loved that you had the custom option with different lengths."
869,Loved My custom skirt!  Came out great! I'm Very thankful for you making on a whim. And speedy shipping
870,"Bethany was very kind to answer all of my questions before I placed my order for a black swim skirt.  I gave her my measurements and the length that I wanted, and it fit perfectly.   I would definitely recommend ordering from Modernly Modest.  Excellent customer service!"
871,Loved my custom made swim skirt!! Thanks Bethany for being so prompt in replying to all my emails and questions! Fits perfectly!!!
872,"I had asked Carolyn if it was possible for her to make and ship a custom swim skirt to me before my vacation a week later, and she had it made and shipped out the very next day! Bought on a Thursday and in my hands on Monday. :)

This is my 2nd skirt that I've purchased from her. Her work is beautiful and to be able to feel so comfortable swimming with my daughters is such a blessing. Thank you so much!"
873,Love this skirt. So comfortable and modest at the same time. I am holiness so I wear long skirts all the time these are great. The price is great too cheaper than everyone else's prices. I love that you measure and then order that way you know exactly how long it will be... Bethany is absolutely great I talked to her like I knew her for years...
874,Love love love my swim skirt!!! Thank you so much!
875,Just what I wanted. Well made. Nice fabric. True to size. Love it! Thanks for getting it to me so quickly!
876,Absolutely perfect.   Thank you so much for rushing it.  You are awesome.  They all fit perfect.
877,I had special ordered the swim skirt in black. It seriously could not fit better! This seller is amazing! I will be back for more. Great quality.
878,If I could give this skirt more stars I would. Best swim cover up EVER!! Beautifully made and shipped quickly. I will definitely buy again from this seller.
879,The seller was so kind and concerned. She kept contact with me to ensure I got exactly what I wanted and really went the extra mile. The skirt I got was amazing.
880,This skirt is exactly what I thought it would be. I am now comfortable swimming in public. It arrived much quicker than was posted which I loved.
881,Perfect.  Thank you so much
882,"Absolutely perfect.   Thank you so much.

891,Great service.  Great skirt. Thank you!
892,Love this sarong!! Great delivery reached quickly.  The item looks better than in the pictures - I have received many compliments during my recent vacation.  Highly recommend this shop.
893,Beautiful! Serves an alternative purpose as a tablecloth.
894,Beautifully made sarong! Lovely and versatile to wear! Great service - quick delivery. Thank you!
895,My niece loved mine so much I had to get her one too!

897,Absolutely beautifuL!  will be ordering more Thank you
898,The beach sarong is perfect! I love the quality and feel of the luxurious rayon fabric. The indigo is a beautiful color. This is exactly what I've been searching for. Customer service was prompt and efficient.
899,high quality..loved it...would definitely buy again
900,Great quality and value! Sizing is perfect
901,This is just beautiful! I have purchased others from this shop.
902,"As a repeat customer, I remained satisfied with this merchant!"
903,"Very nice material, super-fast shipping- Thanks!!!!"
904,lovely <3 and shipped super quick
905,"Beautiful suit.  Very showy with beading.  Not sure I would go in chlorine with it.  More of a party suit than a work horse of a suit.  Way too beautiful to expose to harsh elements.  I am a 38C so the XL top pulls pretty hard to get it to have an appreciable flow in the front part of the tie as in the pic.  Def made for a smaller boned person.  GORGEOUS suit though!  Will wear to special occasions (Yes, in South Florida there are special occasions that require a  bathing suit)!"
906,Love Love Love!  This is such a unique bikini and I can't wait to wear it on my upcoming girls trip to Mexico.  Very well made and so cute. I did go one size up on this top based on Charlotte's suggestion and I'm very happy with the fit.
907,I purchased this for my girls weekend trip (the theme was Cowboys and indians) it was perfect!
908,Again gorgeous detail to these suits. This one was sold out in my size so Charlotte sent another size for me to try. It didn't fit quite right but she is so easy to work with. I sent the suit back and she sent me another based on a style I knew was perfect so I'm a happy customer with two bikinis that I love. Pura Vida I'm off to Costa Rica!!
909,It was worth waiting for. Excellent product. Excellent quality. The details are amazing. Charlotte was amazing and help me all the way thru the process of buying and kept me informed about the status of my order.
910,"it's so cute&good quality.
i love it."
911,Very unique and beautiful. Nice fabric and has a nice fit. Very happy with my purchase.
912,"It took months for this to arrive but I LOVE it and the seller communicated well with me during the waiting period,  keeping me updated.  It's a beautiful suit."
913,Super cute! Love it.. Fits great! Fast shipping. Will order again. Thank you!
914,"en parfait état et fidèle à la description, temps de livraison record et suivi pointu, merci, tout est parfaitement parfait! <3"
915,"Customer service at Floridita is great if you speak with the owner, she's really helpful...and this review is more user error...you have to be built like the model to wear this top...it wraps, has no support or lift at all...if you have the same chest as the model, then go for it...if you are natural, then expect no lift of any kind and coverage is also tough.  Overall the suits are creative and fun!  I will be trying other suits as purchasing swimwear online is always a risk...but I like the concepts and the fact that the suits are unique."
916,"I wasn't sure if I would like this one, but it's my new go-to! Can't wait to order more from Floridita!"
917,The top is so confusing with no support at all. Finally after a group of us figured out how it went all was disappointed! Only for a A & B cup size. The fabric is beautiful however.
918,"The bottoms are perfect and show the right amount, it does run super small as noted in the other comments so I ordered a extra large and it was perfect! Im 5'8 and 140 lbs"
919,Highly recommend these bottoms.  The cut is gorgeous.  Shipped quickly and the construction seems sound.
920,The seller responded fast and was very polite.  He shipped out my bottoms the next day.  I needed them for spring break on the 12th and ordered only a week before and they were here by the 9th.  the only thing I didn't expect was the front to be as low as it was but they fit well and I have no complaints. :) would definitely recommend this seller to a friend
921,The fit was a little off on the first order (my body proportions) but the seller was so great in working with me and suggested the right size for my reorder. Very pleased with the material and can't wait to show it off at the beach.
922,should've stated that it fit very very very petite girls
923,"So cute especially the ruffled part!! It does run super small, definitely order up in size!"
924,I will def order much more from u guys 😍
925,"Owner was patient and very helpful, runs 1-2 sizes small."
926,Feels sexy and comfy ...
927,"I wear mediums in all bathing suit bottoms , I ordered this in a medium and it WAY to small"
928,Fit perfectlu was exactly what i was looking for! Seller shipped the item very quick and it got delivered to me quickly just in time for spring break! Thank you! :)
929,I would give them six stars if possible just for the customer service. I had an issue they fixed it and now the bikini bottoms fit  perfectly.
930,It was a great product but it did run really small. I'm 113 pounds ordered a small and it doesn't fit. But other than that it arrived fast and it was a great product
931,The perfect black bottom! Love it! Can't wait to wear it!
932,"Beautiful, quick shipping. Absolutely love it!"
933,"I ordered size large and it was SO incredibly small. It actually fits my tiny filipino friend who normally wears size small. Use caution when ordering and size up about 3 sizes when possible. Unable to return as its a bathing suit, so I just wasted the $ learning this."
934,"Quick shipment good quality but it was too small ""/"
935,Great seller!! Love my bikini bottoms!
936,Personally not my favorite. I ordered a size small and recieved a size large. When I contacted the seller I never got s response back.
937,Shipped super fast!
938,"I bought a medium. It fit really well it's just too short on the front. I'm not sure I'll be able to wear it due to it looking inappropriate:( 
Beautiful suit though."
939,It's the most beautiful swimwear I have had I also made a youtube video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HQUzAqAzr4&t=1s
940,So sexy and flattering!
941,I thought it was cute! This bikini works well with an hour glass figure!
942,Nice material . Bathing suit as expected.
943,Absolutely perfect!  I have short legs and love the cut of these bikini bottoms because they make my legs look much longer.   Thank you!!
944,Never loved a swim suit bottom so much!
945,This bikini bottom fit perfectly! The shipping was super fast. I will be purchasing more! Seller was very professional and responded quickly to inquiries! Awesome Customer Service!
946,The bottoms were perfect! Just didn't fit my butt. Thank you for being so helpful though! An awesome buyer to purchase from and quick to get here.
947,Arrived quickly and precisely as described.  I really like this bottom.  Nice high cut leg openings but not so revealing in the bottom area.  Would certainly recommend this vendor.
948,Excellent customer service and I have NEVER owned a better fitting pair of bikini bottoms in my life. Absolutely in love and will be back to purchase more!
949,"Perfect fit, great quality."
950,I bought these as a surprise for my wife. I gave a general description of her height and weight and Harajuku was able to produce them in just a few days.  My wife loves them. The material is quality and they fit perfectly. Great and honest Company to work with.
951,Fits great! Great personal attention.
952,Great fit.  Will probably order in several different colors before vacation!
953,The back is coverage is really odd but i like the front
954,Great fit and fast shipping
955,Great item. Exactly as described.
956,"Not true to size, should be made for children"
957,"The swimsuits I ordered for my friends bachelorette party turned out perfect! They cover the butt which is what I was worried about! And they are super cute and still comfy! Run a little small so order a size up! Otherwise, I love! Thank you!"
958,"So cute!! The fabric exceeded our expectations, great quality!! super quick turnaround"
959,These are so cute! And they got here within a couple of days of ordering. I’m very impressed with everything!
960,"Shipping was fast and Owner was quick to respond..  Super cute, they do run a little bit small, would definitely go up a size,  and the only thing is that the white is see through.. 😁"
961,"Shipped on the same day! Definitely order a size up and if you’re tall it does pull a bit on shoulders so be prepared for that! Otherwise, fits and looks great!"
962,Great shirt with amazing quality. You can tell the letters won't peel or fade. I'd definitely recommend this seller and shop!
963,Love these suits! Very good quality and the colors are super vibrant.  Would definitely recommend.
964,Llegaron super rapido.  Nos gustaron mucho.
965,"Great shirt with amazing quality. The white suit is a tad see through when wet, so be careful! You can tell the letters won't peel or fade. I'd definitely recommend this seller and shop!"
966,Super nice to work with.
967,Llegaron super rapido.  Nos gustaron.
968,Llegaron super rapido. Nos gustaron.
969,Llegaron super rapido.  Nos gustaron...

973,These fit great !  Flattering and good quality!
974,Great quality and arrived quick!
975,Great support for fast sending
976,"Ingenious design, XL was the perfect fit for my medium length box braids."
977,"I love the material and color! I have braids now so the size is perfect, without braids it will be to high but that's oke. Your hair gets tiny a little bit wet (back swimming) but I guess that's normal with all swimming caps."
978,"Eindelijk....
Na veel foute badmuts koopjes nu dus een top badmuts.  The max, lange haren blijven droog. En muts is makkelijk op te zetten 👍"
979,Bonjour non seulement je nai pa recu l'article a la date prévue jai donc annulé ma commande qui ma était rembourser et haujourdhui je reçois le bonnet je fait comment pour le retourner votre site de vente pa tres fiable car on peu joindre personne je ferai pa une bonne pub cdl
980,Really great quality product and fast delivery. I ordered an XL which is too large - but that was my fault overestimating my hair volume and large head 😂 I suspect the large will still be a better fit than standard swim caps! Quality is so nice though!
981,I think this item is great for  protecting your braids when swimming.
982,"Leider nicht richtig dicht bei sportlichem - schnellem schwimmen . 
Für alles andere mehr als ausreichend, sieht hochwertig aus ✅"
983,This cap saved my hair! It will stay on and keep voluminous hair from getting soaked with the heavily chlorinated water. The shop owner is extremely responsive! I highly recommend!
984,Swimming cap fits really well. Shipping was very fast and cheap.
985,So glad to have finally found a swim cap that fits all of my natural hair.  Great purchase.
986,I purchased both sizes not really sure of what to get based on metric measurements and how it was being measured versus US sizing. Not everyone fits 'one size fits most'. That really doesn't matter to me now that I have the product in hand. Now I have the freedom to wear my hair however I want and protect it from damaging chlorine and salt water.
987,Bought the burgundy one for a friend and it looks great and fits great too. Would buy again.
988,"shipped super quick! It is a quality, well thought-out swimming cap."
989,"Fits perfectly, fast shipping. Absolutely satisfied! :)"
990,The cap is everything I wanted. Now I have something to keep my hair style looking nice without getting it wet.
991,Ordered on 12/4 still waiting for it to arrive on 12/29/20.
992,Good quality product
993,"According to this site, the response time was good, but unfortunately, I never received the order and the shop never replied to me after I reported the problem to them multiple times.  In the end, I was refunded but would have preferred the cap."
994,The Lavender is gorgeous !! Thank you!!
995,"Too small! Well made and as described, but I seriously doubt a C-cup could get away with this in public. Go at least 1 size up."
996,Absolutely amazing will definitely purchase from the shop again fits perfectly I ordered the 16/18 black high wasted bottoms super comfortable.  I ordered on 11 of May I did also purchase the express shipping and I got it on the 18th.
997,"These are the most perfect swim bottoms. I am not exaggerating. They are well made, completely lined, and PERFECTLY cut. (I ordered the ""full cut"" option). I have been searching for over 3 years for a high waist bottom to mix and match with tops, and even though a full cut-vintage-high waist is the most comfortable and cute for me (a classically curvy lady, size 10-12, who has had 2 kids), the ones out there are always cut weird, ride up, don't rise high enough to the waist, or are clearly made for slimmer body types/sized incorrectly. I am so impressed with these. If they make me feel this gorgeous, they will look/feel good on anybody. These will be the only ones I buy from here on out."
998,"I love these extra high-waisted swimsuit bottoms! I'm 5'4"", 116lbs and a Medium fits perfect. I got them in 2 1/2 weeks, right within the 2-3 week window as promised. They are great quality and are easy to match with multiple tops. Seller replied quickly to my inquiry before purchasing. I would highly recommend!!"
999,Fits perfectly ! First time I went swimming on YEARS.
1000,Toke forever to get it! Didn't look like the pic! The money was way too much for what I got!
1001,"Love this item. Exactly what i was looking for. Nice cut, for the retro look. Very smoothing if you have a bit of a tummy. Thanks!"
1002,"Fits perfectly, very comfortable, and looks super cute! Shop owner is easily contacted and is a pleasure to do business with!"
1003,So flattering and great craftwomanship!
1004,I'm obsessed with these. Fantastic quality. Highly recommend.
1005,"Absolute best bathing suit I have ever had!!!! Love it so much, will be buying again :)"
1006,Fits perfect came fast I can't wait to wear it this summer
1007,these are BEAUTIFUL! they fit wonderfully and the fabric is great
1008,Perfect. I love the way they feel
1009,Awesome quality- love the thickness of the fabric used and shipped on time!
1010,"They're very well made and fit true to size, though I wish they were a little more cheeky !"
1011,"Fabulous high waisted bikini bottoms! Fits true to size and holds you in without any ""overage"".
Perfection!"
1012,Great swim bottom.  Very pleased with my purchase.
1013,This is a great fit and very flattering on!
1014,"Great quality item that fits really well! Very flattering, well-made and comfortable."
1015,"Shipped per timeframe given, provided interim updates, and the bottoms were very well made. Would buy from this seller again."
1016,Love the extra length but the sizing was not consistent with another bottom from the seller. Just a tad loose but it looks and feels great.
1017,I adore this bottom!!!! It's absolutely perfect.  Wonderful fit and quality.  Would LOVE to buy another!
1018,"Makes the back end look super cute! Shipped in decent time, thank you! =)"
1019,Loved everything about it!!! Exactly what I was looking for!
1020,My favorite bikini bottom. Looks awesome on and fits perfectly!!
1021,I adore this shop!! She customs everything to what suits you and your body types.  I feel very sexy yet comfortable when I wear this bottom.
1022,Absolutely love these! The purple color is beautiful too.
1023,Perfect! Just as advertised(:
1024,Perfect. Cant wait to order more
1025,Exactly as described and arrived very fast.
1026,"Love this top! I ordered Gray and it is such a beautiful gray, almost taupe but not. Sewing is seamless and impecible. Material is stretch and swim-like. I'm a 34B/small C and ordered a small. It was true to size. I probably could have ordered a M for more coverage but it stretches and all my lady bits are nicely covered. If your looking for a sexy top, this is it! I am very happy with it, secure, padding was sewn in very subtley and it's just georgeous. Fast, professional correspondence from owner."
1027,"I'm 5'4 and super flat chested, I got the XS and it fits great. I love it! shipped extremely fast as well 💖"
1028,"AMAZING looking top. What you see in the picture is exactly what you get. It's cute, flattering and original. And on top of that the seller is lovely, and shipping is very fast."
1029,"Above everything, this seller was wonderfully responsive to all my questions/requests. Beautiful top. And for the first time in a while I found a swimsuit top that is actually comfortable AND stylish."
1030,"I could not love this bathing suit top more! I ordered one with our padding and it's perfect. A flattering fit, a unique design and soft comfy material. I'm definitely going to buy more colors!"
1031,I love it!!!! Fits perfectly!!
1032,"Shipped quickly. You have to get this bikini top. Well made, fabric is silky and two layers, so very modest. The wrap detail is so cute. I feel very comfortable and secure. No worries with this top."
1033,"Delighted with the fit of this top. Looks as good in as in the picture. Haven't been in the water with it yet but it's well made and good quality material. Excellent for the price. I'm a 32D and It's just the right amount of coverage and support but still sexy for the beach. Good sizing advice from the seller, good communications and v prompt delivery. So pleased I'm going to order another in a different colour."
1034,"I love this top and cannot wait to wear it on my honeymoon! Only wish the pads weren't so visible (as seen in the photo). Other than that, perfect."
1035,"Beautiful top and great service. Thought the import fees to Canada were a little high, but that is in no way the seller's issue. Just be prepared!"
1036,This bikini top is great! I really like it. The store owner answers questions very quickly. I am very pleased with my purchase. Very fast shipping too!
1037,"I loooooove this top!  I'd prefer if it weren't padded, but it fits great!   It's my lucky top :)"
1038,Beautiful bathing suit top. Wish the pads were removable as they do show through a bit. But I knew that ahead of time and that didn't deter me.
1039,"great material, love this top!"
1040,Lovely top. Enjoying it now on my holiday
1041,"love it, thanks so much!"
1042,This top fits so well and is sleek and sexy.
1043,👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼 Nailed it
1044,"Excellent quality, great product! Love it!"
1045,"Item was shipped and received within a week, and is very comfy and beautiful!"
1046,Great top!  Highly recommended.  Fast and effective shipping.
1047,Well made and looks exactly like the photo.
1048,"Gorgeous! the material lays so comfortably on skin, its fabulous!! thank you! (as for fit, I usually wear a large top (34d) and xs-s bottoms and this fits a little snug, but I don't mind having a 'less is more' bathing suit)"
1049,"Very cute. Runs a bit small. I even ordered a size up from what the size chart told me I needed. It fits, but it could be a bit longer for more comfort/room in the crotch. They shipped it right away and it got to the U.S within a week!"
1050,Fits so nicely!! A dreamy suit that hugs curves beautifully- highly recommend.
1051,Soft and comfortable fabric. I feel amazing in it!
1052,I like it a lot. Thank you
1053,"shipping time was crazy, cute top otherwise."
1054,It's so nice and it siuts me so good... Thank you
1055,This item wasn't exactly as shown in the picture. It has strings at the top that aren't in the picture at all. It's still cute though and shipping was fast.
1056,The shirt is very cute.
1057,Fantastic swimsuit bottoms! Really high leg exactly what I wanted. I’m 5’3” and 143lbs I was in the middle of a M and L so I decided to go for the L and they’re prefect.
1058,I liked the black pair so much I ordered a white one :) I have natural hip dips so when I wear regular bottoms it looks like they're too tight on me. These sit just above my hips and look great!
1059,LOVE LOVE LOVE !! fit perfectly! Love everything about them ! Just ordered another pair that's on way ! And might order a few more in other colors ! In love ❤️
1060,"I couldn't be happier with my purchase! Delivered right on time, excellent quality and fit better than I had hoped. I will definitely be purchasing from this shop again! Love it. Thanks so much =]"
1061,Love the high hip bottom. Will be getting more colors.
1062,"Great quality, responsive seller! Not quite confident enough to post a pic of me wearing it just yet lol but to give you an idea, I'm 5'5"" 135 with 39"" hips and the medium fits nicely. You can send your measurements to the seller, and she can make modifications/recommendations for you."
1063,"I absolutely love these, I was looking for more of a high waist bikini bottom and this was perfect. Definitely will be buying more."
1064,this is the perfect high hip bottom!
1065,Beautifully made and quality . I order two and I am gonna get a third one!!!!
1066,"I'm a size 8 in jeans and bought a medium. Love the bottoms, but think I could have fit in the large for an even higher cut."
1067,Highly recommend! The material is well made and looks amazing on. Great response time when messaging! Will buy again!
1068,"Super cute, fit perfectly."
1069,"Just got them in and they are PERFECT. I have a bigger-than-average booty, but these bottoms show off the perfect amount! Not a thong, nor are they granny panties. They fit great and are super comfortable. I WILL be ordering these in several more colors!!!"
1070,This was my third purchase and it as always came in perfect and in a timely manner! I will always purchase from here for my swimsuits!
1071,These suits are such good quality I rarely leave reviews but I rarely find an actual swimsuit that Looks good when you put it on because the person who made it knows where to place the stitching etc. I wish I found these a long time ago.
1072,Just a titch tighter than what measurements said but overall a beautiful suit and great quality!
1073,The quality is amazing. And it fits exactly perfectly as expected. I'm a 32 B and ordered a small.
1074,"Love the fit, super cute and would buy it in other colors! Only down side is the stitching was falling apart a little when it arrived but it was an easy fix"
1075,"Shipping takes a bit, but well worth the wait"
1076,"Could be a little bigger. Overall, i like them though!"
1077,Was to small and I got my right size
1078,Great Product and Great Service
1079,I am at a lost for words this bathing suit came out better than my expectations my daughter is going to love it thank you so so much this made me so happy to receive today!
1080,They look amazing and delivered within a few days. Communication was on great and the girls loved loved loved there bathing suits. 😍
1081,My girls LOVED their custom suits!
1082,"Not much comment, hands down. Fast shipping right on time thank you!! Birthday crew was lit!!!"
1083,"I ordered 14 of these and boy the postal system had me so nervous but they arrive right as I was leaving for my daughter's 5th birthday trip. 
They're so cute and durable. They and their parents loved it!"
1084,"Love! Came out so cute and made my baby girl feel special during this weird pandemic time. 

My little one wears a 3T but a 2T would have fit a bit firmer to keep the straps in place. Besides that would absolutely recommend"
1085,The swimsuit is perfect !!!
1086,I have ordered from this vendor more than once and both times the seller was quick in responding. On a recent order I requested changes and there was no hesitation to get my order corrected right away. They only reason I gave 4 starts instead of 5 was the fit of them swimsuit was a little off but satisfied nonetheless!
1087,The letters are already peeling off and looks very cheap. Would not recommend
1088,"I am 5""4 with a bigger bust and larger hips so finding swimsuits that cover my girls but are still sexy is hard. I absolutely love this suit! I feel like I won't pop out and show just enough to make it suitable for around the family. The swimsuit is soft and hugs your body right! Thank you!!"
1089,Fits perfectly. Thank you
1090,"Lovely!! Perfect fit, can't wait for summer to arrive so i can wear this cute bathing suit"
1091,My daughter loves these bottoms! She is wearing it today while she vacations in Costa Rica. 😀 thanks again.
1092,"Skinflickfashion was able to custom order my swimsuit in a different color, and it was even better than I had hoped! The material is thick enough to not be see-through so there is more coverage than what the photos suggest. Also, the bottoms are possibly the cutest swimsuit bottoms I have ever owned. All in all, this is a great suit that no one else will be sporting on the beach that looks like it weill hold up well over time. 

The seller was great, shipped on time, and super friendly and flexible. Definitely will recommend this seller to my friends (as long as they dont buy the same suit...)"
1093,This suit absolutely rocks!  I have found my favorite suit for summer of 2014!
1094,This looks so freakin hott I am so excitedddd!!!!!!!
1095,So in love with this suit! It is absolutely gorgeous! Thank you so much! I cannot wait to get more for this summer!
1096,"I put the bikini on, and all of a sudden I felt incredible sexy!! this is a great design and perfect fit for me! Thanks for all your great advice :)"
1097,"I have ordered the size M. It fit me very well! And covered nice the back.

Reallyyyy love it!! Can't wait to wear it"
1098,These are now my favorite bottoms that I have ever owned!!!!
1099,Love the design. Material seems delicate.
1100,super sexy & great fit! thank you :)
1101,thank you very much! quick shipping.
1102,Was perfect for my daughters Barbie themed birthday party 🥰💖
1103,Muy buena calidad y ajusta perfecto @dayana.latinafit
1104,"Very cute, but the medium leans more on the smaller side (M/S) and the straps are thin (maybe an inch of strap), because it its tighter on me they roll up which I'm not a fan of. The inside is also white not pink like the picture shows. Overall cute suit and would recommend to others."
1105,Love everything about it! Thanks!
1106,The swimsuit is very cute! Would recommend.
1107,fits amazing! cant wait to wear again
1108,"Omg!!!! I'm in LOVE. I'm 5'0, 120 lbs, measurements 33-28-34 and the M/L fits perfectly!! Im normally a size 4/6 in bathing suits and dresses. I'm glad I didn't get the bigger size. The seller was swift and responsive when I had questions and she even did a preview of the suit for me to decide if I liked the font. I received my custom bathing suit today and ordered it Dec 27. Came just in time for my trip to Central America in a few weeks. I ordered a red and I plan to order another one in white this week. It rides high in the hip area and that's exactly the look I'm going for. It looks so sexy on me. Thank you ADashofChic!"
1109,I am 5'8 and 145 pounds. I got a size XL. I have a long torso so the only issue I came across is it almost not being long enough. It has padding(awesome) and isn't a cheap material. I'm obsessed with it and can't wait to rock it in Mexico! The lady was super quick at responding to questions and I got it within 3 business days!
1110,"This was the perfect suit for a girls weekend in Palm Springs! I was the only one who bought a custom suit (THUG WIFE). Everyone else got theirs on cheap websites and the difference was huge!! My suit was high quality material, that held up in the water and slimmed me down. It had the built in bra for support which was SO helpful! The sides were moderately high on my hips and the back was low- just how I wanted it. I am the only one who is going to wear their suit again and again after the trip. I am SO glad I decided to go with a custom order from this shop! I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality customized one piece."
1111,"I love this bikini!!!! Got this for my girlfriend for her bachelorette party and it is amazing!!! The fit is perfect, and I was on a bit of a time crunch but the shop owner was so sweet, so kind, quick to respond and so helpful, she quickly made the custom bikini and sent it out right away. I got it very fast and it looks incredible!!! You can tell that it is made with good quality and not the cheap weird fitting bikinis that are sold elsewhere. So happy thank you!!"
1112,"Ordered a custom bathing suit with my new married name for our wedding BBQ/Pool Party.  Ordered on a Sunday and it arrived on Wednesday; thank you for the quick turnaround! Fit runs small - I am a size 4/6 and the M/L felt tight (I do have a long torso).  Nonetheless, I braved it and everyone thought the swim suit was awesome!  Highly recommend."
1113,She is the best!! Super attentive responsive and accommodating !!! The swimsuits look great too
1114,"Excellent customer service! Suit does run small- I'm 5'9, size 6, 34DD. My torso is pretty long but the XL fit well! Nice materials and I received a ton of compliments."
1115,"Shipping time was so fast! Only thing is the sizing is a little off. I am 130 lbs and got an extra large(because of the reviews I had read) ...while the bottom part fit extremely snug, the straps are falling off. Also with any color besides black, you can see the padded area in the middle/top of the bathing suit. Overall nice quality though!"
1116,Love this product!!  Got so many compliments.  The seller was great to work with.  Amazing Etsy seller with quality results. Runs small- definitely recommend getting a size bigger than you're used to.
1117,Ordered 5 custom suits last minute and asked for 2 day shipping. She was very accommodating and it even arrived early.  Process was quick and easy and they look awesome!! :)
1118,Purchased these for my bachelorette weekend and my friends loved them. The fit was great and the sewn in cups were a nice touch.
1119,Love my custom one piece!
1120,Love my custom one piece!
1121,I loved this suit but it was too small! :(
1122,Super cute suit!!! Fit is a little strange but overall I really love it!
1123,Absolutely loved my custom swim suit. Communication was really fast and so was shipping. There was some confusion with the order and I was sent a new one within the week. Would definitely recommend!
1124,I ordered a suit for my MOH and it fits perfectly and she loves it! Came in super fast too!
1125,Perfect !!!
1126,"Love love love the suits!!!!! Beautiful, sexy, comfy and well made! So pleased"
1127,Obsessed!!! Quick shipping! I love it!!!
1128,Showing off our college picks at the beach! They happen to be rivals... University of Kentucky Cats vs University of Louisville Cards!
1129,Shop owner was very helpful in making sure I ordered the correct size. The bathing suit fit perfectly when I tried it on. I would recommend going a size larger than normal size because the bathing suits do run small. Very comfortable and made well.
1130,got it fast and is exactly what I wanted!! wish it wasn't as see through in belly button area:/ but overall love love love!!
1131,"Love the suit!! Great quality and fast shipment. Just a heads up if you're questioning what size to get...I'm normally a size 8-10 and am 6' tall, and the XL is just barely long enough."
1132,"The shipping and response time was prompt, but besides that the quality of the swimsuit wasn't as good as I thought. I purchased a total of 8 swimsuits and none of the swimsuits fit any of us, the straps on the shoulder was too big on all of us so it just kept sliding off as we were wearing it. Not to mention the padding isn't sewn on, so it just falls. After wearing it once, I decided to hand wash it and a lot of red dyes comes right off, so make sure your not leaving it on anything white to air dry. A little more than disappointed that we spend 50+ on this swimsuit that doesn't fit"
1133,"the quality and delivery were great, the size is hard to perfect. but great overall"
1134,"Love love love my swimsuit I got! I ordered a custom suit, looks great, fits great and received it very fast!"
1135,it fits perfectly and the print is flawless. Thanks!
1136,"Came fast, good quality. Sizing guide worked for me, I'm 5'7 145 and M/L worked fine if you don't mind how high the leg comes up."
1137,Love the piece :)
1138,"Seller was responsive, it arrived quickly, and fits/looks great! Definitely recommend ordering up a size."
1139,"It arrived even earlier than expected, and the product is absolutely perfect.  Will be ordering from this seller again."
1140,"The bathing suit is perfect WITH the exception that it doesn't fit - the torso is about 5 inches too short and I ordered the XL. It's so cute and I am bugged it won't work for my Vegas pool party but I ordered other things and those will do! The customer service was exceptional - even with the fact that she can not exchange custom orders, which makes sense it's my own fault I didn't read thoroughly. I will definitely be ordering again in the future! I ordered my stuff Friday and it was in my mailbox on Monday!"
1141,One of the best things I've purchased on etsy! The suit fits perfectly and looks great too.
1142,Fits great! I'm 5'8 and got a M/L
1143,"I am 5'9"" tall and 120lbs and the M/L size was quite short length wise and width...felt more like a size S/M in all honesty. Other than sizing, the text came out great and the actual swimsuit fabric quality seems great. Will have to try stretching it out a bit since it is very snug."
1144,"I love the custom print work. And the customer service is amazing, they made sure I liked it and even sent me a new size after accidentally sending me the wrong one. 
However, if you are any bigger than a size 2, I highly recommend not purchasing this suit. Very disappointed in the sizing they have. I am 5'5 and 130 lbs, I wear a C cup bra and have a booty, I ordered an XL and it still is fitting way too snug.... I am normally a small/medium and size 4. I just wish they would purchase their suits elsewhere where the sizing is more appropriate and not so discriminating!"
1145,Fit great and shipped promptly. Seller answered my question within same day!
1146,Seller answered all my questions and helped me order the correct size. Fits great :) I'm bachelorette wkend ready! Thank you!
1147,"I received my bathing suit the delivery was fast which was awesome, but the suit wasn't! 😪 I specifically gave my measurements and stated I wanted a scrunch butt, which she told me she didn't have but the "" bathing suit is a little cheeky"" so I made sure to ask all my concerns before I ordered. When the suit came, first of all the suits straps does not stay on, and the back is FULL coverage. Also the suit does not lay on the body well. The material is good, but that's it! When I contacted her she told me to "" hike the sides up so it can show a bit more cheeks"" really??!!! I surely will not be ordering from her no more. Ordering on line clothing is fast and reasonable but when you get the suit, it's nothing like you expected and disappointed. So now I'm left with a bathing I will probably not wear!!!!! 😪😪😩👎👎👎👎"
1148,I love the built in breast pads!
1149,Fit was horrible. I am a size 4 and the m/L fit so awkward. It was too short in the torso so either it came up too high or my boobs looked bad but really they just looked bad the whole time. Definitely would recommend getting a bodysuit material over this swimsuit
1150,"I ordered a Large, the item was very short. I’m 5’1; both the owner and I were boggled?! Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to return or exchange the item and/or get the full amount for it. 😐😑 However, she was more than willing to help me with different options. I can’t wait to get and see my personalized MRS. jean jacket! Thanks again babe. 😘"
1151,"Very cute swimsuit idea! Loved that they printed it the exact way I wanted it to look. It is also very nice that it has padding! My friends ordered there's elsewhere and they nevvvver had any padding! Do wish the sizing was more accurate. I am a size 2 normally with no boobs and no butt and ordered the M/L after reading the reviews and asking for guidance and it is way too small, very misleading. Disappointed because it was pricey for something I will never be able to wear. But if you get the sizing right it is a GREAT quality swimsuit!"
1152,"Contacted the seller before I bought it to get her opinion on what size I should buy. It still didn't fit, sucks that I threw $60 in the trash. I wouldn't recommend it since the sizes are so off."
1153,Shipping was really fast! Thanks
1154,"Awesome company, my second time ordering from them and I will again."
1155,"Speedy service. Ordered the extra-large which is definitely big in the straps, but it's better than being a bit too small? Probably could have gone with the medium, knowing that this style is high in the bottom area."
1156,Very helpful and understanding!
1157,Yes it Shipped on time
1158,Cheap material for how much they charge on top of horrible customer service. Very disappointed with this purchase. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
1159,I unfortunately cannot wear the bathing suit I ordered. I am a size large and I ordered a large. The large fit like a size small. I could barely fit into it. I was very disappointed. It it had fit me right- I would have given a 5 star rating.
1160,"I am absolutely in love with this swimsuit! So happy I bought it! 
It came nicely packaged and the colors are exactly as shown in the posting. The material is amazing - slightly thick yet very stretchy and extremely pleasant to touch. The white waist stripe lined up perfectly with my waist line. 
I am always very hesitant about buying clothes online and spent forever trying to decide on the size (I am S top, M bottom and all my other swimsuits are S). In case this helps anyone, I bought an M (it fits me well!) and I am: bust 35, waist 29, hip 41 and torso 63. Be careful if you have a longer torso as even though the straps can be extended, you still need the swimsuit to cover your chest nicely:) As some have mentioned here, the edges are a bit tighter around the hip - something to keep in mind if you have a pear body shape."
1161,"Love it!  Retro style suit. The design with the white lines makes my waist look smaller ;-)  I originally got a Medium but had to send it back in for a Small.  I'm 5'3"" 125 lbs.  34-28-38"
1162,"such a fun and gorgeous piece--- i feel great in it as it's so flattering, and most importantly, it's SO COMFORTABLE.

this was shipped so quickly with very good packaging.

can't wait to buy more xx"
1163,"Very well made! I ordered a medium because I am usually a small up top and a medium on bottom. I was nervous about the top not fitting or it being too short because I'm 5'9"", but the straps are adjustable so it worked out well. The entire suit is lined and the top is slightly padded, which I was thankful for in the water."
1164,"Was headed for a sailing trip to Croatia and wanted a glamorous, elegant one-piece swimsuit.  Modest but sexy.  Everything I saw was so boring, so over-priced, so... done.  So I decided to give Etsy a try for something different.  The suit was exquisite and generated ample compliments.  One Manhattan PR fashionista on my trip went on and on about how beautiful the swimsuit was... ""I have to say it again,"" she said. ""That suit is simply stunning! Where did you get it?""

The designer, who is a real talent, was such a darling and went out of her way to get my exact measurements and ship the suit to me ASAP.  Was in my mailbox in 3 days.

Can't say enough about how glamorous I felt sailing the Adriatic in this suit.  The service and reasonable price put it over the top.  I would have paid twice as much.  5 stars."
1165,I love it; it fits great and the material feels great.
1166,"The pattern is really pretty. But the material wasn't as stretchy as I'd expect for a bathing suit, and the cut was weird. I have a pretty standard body shape for size Small, and the top of this bathing suit gaped weirdly, like chest and shoulders are meant to be a lot wider than the hips.
I'm going to try to return this cause it looks really awkward on me."
1167,Thankyou so much..great quality and looks gorgeous!
1168,"It was shipped on time and the packaging is very nice. The edges are too tight vs the rest of the material around the hip, it's probably more suitable for apple silhouette vs pear type, but this is something you cannot know in advance. Still I dont regret for my purchase, the pattern and colors are very impressive."
1169,Perfect fit following the sizing chart and good quality material used. Looking forward to using both swimsuits when it's safe to travel again :)
1170,"Erster Eindruck, da ich ihn noch nicht im Wasser ausprobiert habe:
Sehr schöner Bikini! 
Sitzt gut & ist angenehm weich. 
Beim Bikinihöschen war ich überrascht, weil ich dachte, dass ein Unterstoff eingenäht wäre. Ist jedoch nicht so. Hoffe also dass er Blickdicht ist. :)"
1171,Best ship ever! They went above and beyond for me! I couldn’t be more pleased!
1172,Pom is so helpful and makes sure you're happy with your purchase. All etsy sellers should be like her!!! Thank you!
1173,"wunderschöner Bikini, vielen Dank dafür :)"
1174,"Very good owner and I love this bikini soooo much, very good made :)

Thank you !
Arigatougozaimasu!"
1175,Just beautiful! Thank you.
1176,Very kind & quick response! And this product is so cute!
1177,"Erin I am sure you hear this all the time but I love you. You are incredibly talented and make me feel so amazing every time I put on one of your pieces. How many women say that about swim wear? As promised I attached pictures from a larger bust perspective, please feel free to use. Excuse the jeans I was too excited when the package came. For size reference I wear a 36DD and a size 8 jeans and your sizing was once again spot on. The large might work for others but this way I feel I am not in fear of spilling out the sides or exposing a nipple ;). I'm planning on purchasing more soon for my trip and lounging in the backyard."
1178,"I got a size smaller, as a 34G, I needed the L, not the XL, and I got rainbow stripe. Couldn't have picked a better combination! I am in love."
1179,I love my new cheeky bikini! I feel so freaking cute in it and love the fabric quality. Erin answered any and all of my questions about sizing and it was evident when it arrived and I didn't need to exchange! :)
1180,"First off, this top is so soft! I have the one piece and that peice is a bit thicker in material but this top is so nice! You can definitely tell that this top will last multiple trips to the beach and water parks all summer long. I also ordered the high waisted bottoms in Forrest Green. I have red hair and ordered the green because it makes the color of my hair and the suit pop! My next order will be the bandeau top for sure!"
1181,"Erin is fantastic! Her bathing suits are well designed and super high quality, and I'm happy to recommend them to all my friends. I love shopping local and these bathing suits are way better than any you can buy in the store anyway! The patterns are adorable, too. Love my watermelon swimsuit. Thanks, Erin!"
1182,The best bikini top I have ever owned. I am a 36D and it fit perfectly! The construction is impeccable and comfortably lifts chest in the most flattering way. Amazing.
1183,The top is so comfortable and secure. I was able to swim in the ocean without worrying about anything popping out. Thanks Erin!!
1184,"I was worried about getting this top because I’m pretty small on my top end, but this top accentuates super well! Definitely recommend trying it out. 👌🏼"
1185,"This bikini top is possibly my most favorite bikini top I've ever owned. I want to buy 8 more! But my wallet won't let me. The top holds my girls well, and offers great support, unlike every other bikini top I've had. The side coverage is probably my favorite part, because I'm always so conscious of my side boob. I love, love, love this! If you're looking for a sign to get a bikini top...please get this one!"
1186,Erin is amazing. This top is amazing. She always knows what you need even though she's never seen your body. It's pretty amazing. Thank you for creating this magical piece that makes my boobs look like I've got a great pair! You are the best! xx
1187,Love how this top hides my side rolls and yet makes me feel so sexy and comfortable. It holds everything in place. Success !
1188,the perfect top! i love it!! will definitely be recommending to others
1189,"Best bikini ever ! I was nervous about ordering online without trying first, but tired of going to numerous stores and never finding my perfect fit (38DDD). This was such a great buy !! Medium rise bottom and one piece swimsuit are genius too. Erin is also a pleasure to deal with. Will get more bikinis for sure !"
1190,"Love this, very flattering. Bottoms are wonderful just need to get toned and in better shape for it to look best. Erin is so easy to work with and made everything so simple and easy. Highly recommend."
1191,"Love it! I have a small breast, but it is still a very flattering top! Erin gives amazing client service and makes beautiful products! I took the plum color and it is beautiful!"
1192,"I call this the ""magic top"" because it really does do everything Erin says! Very flattering and fits great! I am a 34 or a 36 DD depending on the bra. I was afraid the top might not fit but it does perfectly! It's like she made it for me specifically lol. I also have the cheeky bottoms that I love! I would love love love for Erin to introduce a ""modest cheeky"" that has half the cheekiness for times I want to be a bIt more covered but with the same type of cut!"
1193,"Love the material but I would order a size up if you are heavy chested! Got a matching bottom and top, and the colors are identical. I look forward to ordering more from TCB!"
1194,So cute!! Love the back of it. Erin conviced me to get a medium and I'm glad I listened to her!
1195,"Let me say this first... I've never bought a bikini before... ever! I was so nervous to buy them, but Erin was very fast and kind in answering all my questions throughout the entire ordering process. I cannot say enough how accommodating and understanding Erin is of women and our insecurities when chatting with her. I wore this top with black/plum high waist cheeky bikini bottoms and mid waist +1 inch black cheeky bikini bottoms as well. This is my favorite!
I bought the Large because I wear a 36 C-D, but probably should've gone smaller just because I like the extra security, but I'll just get another one in the near future! If you're at all questioning this top, DO NOT QUESTION. Buy it! If you have questions, contact Erin, you won't regret either decision. I've never felt more comfortable (in a bikini) and so glad I got them!"
1196,I looooooove my cheeky bikini - especially now that it's a complete set! Thank you for your continued awesome customer service! I'll be back for more!
1197,"I absolutely love this top! It's so comfortable and flattering. Erin, you're amazing :)"
1198,"I can’t say enough about the comfort and fit of this top! I wish I could share more photos but can’t figure out how to share more than 1. This top is sexy and shows off your chest, arms, and back in the most flattering way. I was so hesitant to buy one of these bikinis because I was afraid that it wouldn’t look as good on me as I thought it would but man oh man! I wish I had bought more and sooner! For those curvy girls browsing and not seeing your size/shape represented in the reviews I hope this helps! I am a size 16/18 pant, 40 C bra, XL/2X top, and typically buy suits from swimsuits for all in a size 18 or Old Navy in a XL."
1199,Love how comfy this top is. Wearing an XL here and I wear a 38D or 36DD in bras. Excellent seller who communicates regarding sizing. Already purchased my third bikini from this store!
1200,"Loved the fit of this bathing suit. Erin was very helpful and made sure I got the size that would fit me the best. I would definitely buy again, one of the most flattering bathing suits I own!"
1201,Love love love this top. Extremely comfortable ands fits perfectly.
1202,This top is fantastic!!! fits great! I feel secure and held! Will definitely be ordering another!
1203,I'm a 34GG and this fits beautifully and looks great. I'm so happy with my purchase!
1204,Bet fitting bathing suit top I own! Just enough coverage. Well made and goes great with the cheeky bottoms I got last year! Thank you!
1205,"If you're thinking about it, stop thinking & purchase this top!! I have a bigger chest and other tops dig into my shoulders and shove my boob into my face. This top is so comfortable, flattering, and comes highly recommended! Erin is a pleasure to communicate with and goes above and beyond to make sure you love your purchase!"
1206,"Very comfortable! Once I told them my sizing, they actually custom made a medium with small cups."
1207,Erin is awesome to work with and will make sure you are satisfied with your purchase!! Msg her for sizing!! I will be ordering more!
1208,I am a 36D and ordered the Large. It fits great. You need to pull the top down lower than you might expect at first but when you do the top is very flattering even with a M-L chest size.
1209,Love this bikini!!! Great fit and very comfy!! :)
1210,Absolutely love these tops!! So flattering!!!
1211,Absolutely love these tops!! So flattering!!!
1212,Absolutely love these tops!! So flattering!!!
1213,"As a plus sized woman, I have a hard time feeling sexy AND confident in a swim suit. I felt both when I tried this on. The seller was so sweet and did what she could to make sure I picked the right sizes. I highly recommend. Thanks again!"
1214,Very flattering and supportive!! ❤️
1215,So comfortable and chic 💕 I love the design and fabric so much
1216,Love this top! Can’t wait for the front tie top 😁 ❤️
1217,Love my top! Fits amazingly
1218,So comfy!!  Love the top and the excellent service received from Erin.  She'll answer any question you have and make sure you are comfortable.
1219,Beautiful!!
1220,"PERFECTION! I'm obsessed and can't wait to order more! Fit perfect according to my bra size! Most importantly, it hides trouble areas and I feel amazing In it!"
1221,So flattering and sexy !
1222,"I didn't know if this would work for me being very small chested, but it is super cute and very flattering. Thanks, Erin!"
1223,This top is lovely but definitely doesn't offer the support necessary to wear for a real beach day!
1224,Love the top! Can't wait to wear it on vacation with my cheeky bottoms. Erin made sure the size I ordered was the right size just like she did when I originally ordered bottoms back in the fall.
1225,The red is an amazing color and the top is perfect and cute. I love it!
1226,Seriously THE BEST bikini I’ve EVER purchased
1227,Love the fit and arrived in time!
1228,"The backing on this made me fall in love!!! For stubborn back rolls (ahem ahem lol) they are kept a secret while still giving you that sexy feeling with a plunging neckline out front. They do not come with paddings, but it makes me feel more of a woman bc it let's me embrace it. I'm pro-free the nipple movement btw :) I'm a 32/34B-cup and the medium is perfect! Erin is superb with her customer service. She really takes the time to make sure that you pick the right size! Def will get another set :)"
1229,Erin is amazing! She was so quick with seeing if I ordered the correct size & when I didn’t feel comfortable with the size it was no hassle in exchanging for a different size.
1230,amazing!!! great customer service and amazing quality product!
1231,Many compliments on this stylish & comfortable top
1232,"New favorite top! Extremely comfortable, and lays very well. I have a larger chest and the XL top provides great coverage."
1233,This is the most flattering bikini top I have ever bought and it is so comfortable. I will definitely be ordering more!
1234,Love how low this sits. It minimizes back rolls and is super comfortable.
1235,Super flattering especially when paired with the high-wasted bottoms.
1236,Great fit. Wonderfully sexy
1237,"Let me start off by saying that the seller is fantastic. Top notch customer service but I have minor issues with garment quality. The top is double lined with a black liner on the inside of my “rust” orange top, which rolls over a bit on some edges as I move to expose the black underneath. I just don’t understand why it wouldn’t be the same fabric or at least a less contrasting white like most budget swimwear. 

Also somehwhat disappointingly, the rust orange is more like a pumpkin orange. My fault for ordering stuff online. No cup, no corner hole in the lining to slip one in either, so it’s nipply, but the style is great."
1238,"The top is made well, but unfortunately does not fit me properly. The bottom bunches up and is not flattering on my body type. I've purchased bottoms from this shop and love them, but the top was not meant for me. :("
1239,"I just totally fell in love with my new bikini!! It fits perfectly and it is of extremely high quality !! The Bikini is also very comfortable and just a unique piece of Art :) 
The time that i was waiting until it arrived ,was so worth it!! :) 

Size - Top ( 75D ) Bottom ( S) 
I live in Europe"
1240,Absolutely beautiful!! GORGEOUS!! I’m so excited to wear it. Dragana is wonderful and so talented!!
1241,Absolutely love it. Great service and fits like a dream!
1242,"The craftmanship is beautiful, and the customer service was amazing. We had a miscommunication about colour and the offer to fix it was immediate. You couldn't ask for better!"
1243,Beautiful and high quality! The designer is very kind and works with you to create the best piece for your body. :)
1244,Fits very nice. Good material.
1245,I was so pleasantly surprised when my new swim suit arrived!  I was a little concerned as there were no pictures of the back of the suit nor the interior lining.  It is a very high quality swim suit; nicely sewn with good quality material.  I wore it to a trip to Dominican Republic and it held up beautifully in the ocean.  This was my first attempt at a bikini and I felt beautiful in it.  Bikiniboo was wonderful to work with too.  My size was originally not available but she was able to restock quickly so I could get it in time for my trip.  She was very sweet.  Thank you so much.  I never thought I could feel so good in a bikini!
1246,"I love this bathing suit SO MUCH. The seller is extremely kind and this is so well made, comfortable, and absolutely adorable. 10/10 would and will buy again. I tried it on as soon as I got it, and now I can't wait to go show it off. It shows the perfect amount of booty but not too much to where you couldn't wear it out with family. It's conservative, yet sexy. I have never felt so confident in a bathing suit!"
1247,"I bought two bikinis from this shop, and I don't know which one I love more. These are clearly better than any bathing suit I have ever owned. They get so many compliments and make me feel confident in my body. These pieces are instrumental to a Hot Girl Summer lookbook."
1248,"So amazing! Easily the cutest swimsuit I’ve ever owned! Super well-made and fits me perfectly. I love it!!! <3 
Thank you so much!"
1249,"Gorgeous bikini! I love it. It’s the first time in 35 years that I’ve bought/worn a bikini. It’s beautifully made, comfortable and makes me feel good/confident. Quick delivery. Great communication from the seller. It arrived in perfect condition. I’m very pleased. Excellent seller :)"
1250,"I love it! 
The whole experience was wonderful, she was very nice and made sure I received my parcel. The bikini is gorgeous just what I expected, I love its perfect!"
1251,"I love my bikini! It looks exactly like the picture, and fits great. The shipping was prompt and it came with a sweet little hand written note. I would definitely recommend this shop to others:)"
1252,"Such a classic style! I had to order a different sized top than bottom, and they both fit amazingly well. Super flattering, and it shipped very quickly to the States! I also ordered two one-piece suits, so I am definitely a huge fan!"
1253,Love my new swim wear!!
1254,"Runs a little looser, but I love the fit and design! Way more comfy and confidant on the beach!"
1255,I absolutely LOVE this swimsuit.  It fit me perfect and covers all of the right places.  The price is definately right too.  Shipping was fast to the US and the seller was so pleasant to do business with.  Thank you.
1256,This is the 4th swimsuit I've had from bikini boo.. The material is fab.. As soon as you open your pink package you will smile.😁 Arrived in great time and its always a pleasure to speak to Kerry.. You won't be disappointed.
1257,"Amazing! Fast delivery, super service, fits perfectly. And the Christmas card was such a nice touch. Thankyou!! Xx"
1258,"It took foooorever to get here. Ordered December 10th, 2017. It arrived January 9th, 2018. The bikini is pretty decent."
1259,This suit is everything promised & more! Purchased to wear in Hawaii & received tons of compliments. Come summertime I will definitely be ordering another! Thanks for the wonderful product bikiniboo!!
1260,"Love these suits, I ordered 4 and they are all amazing!"
1261,"It's a little big, but excellent quality and well made!"
1262,Comfy and perfect fit lovely experience
1263,"Retro Cool, can't wait to wear it"
1264,Excellent customer service. Tanks!
1265,Beautiful Bikini. It's exactely what I was looking for.
1266,"Wonderful service from this seller.
Gorgeous item 
Highly recommended"
1267,"Ugh, I can't justifiably express how in love I am with my new kini💗🦋 made with complete aloha straight from the aina, you can feel it in the fabric🌈 my sister also loves her seamless bottoms SO much, we have been obsessing over our kinis ever since we received them. They were exactly what I imagined and beyond!! Mahalo siSTAR!!"
1268,"Super cute, love the fit , she was able to customize it for my frame! 💜"
1269,This is my 4th Niukini bikini and it sure didn’t disappoint! Love the sand colour! Already thinking of getting morr in different colours!
1270,"I LOVE this top!!! It's so cute and comfortable and fits perfectly (hugs the body's curves in a wonderful way). I immediately ordered another, plus a suit for my sister...she saw and wanted her own!"
1271,"LOVE LOVE LOVE fits beautifully and covers great!! I'm a 36C/34D(D) -depending on brand- so I took the large

Great thick material, hasn't unraveled yet, which is a common problem with most swimsuits I have.
Thank you for such a beautiful early Christmas present!!!! :-)"
1272,The bikini top fits perfectly. And I'm very happy with it. Thanks a lot! Summer is calling! :o)
1273,"I bought this for my wife on our honeymoon and she loved it! And so did I. She is a 75B/34B and the Medium size was perfect. 
Thank you also for great and fast service:)"
1274,"Super cute, great quality. Fit is a little small for my 34b chest, but a little extra skin never hurt anyone ;)."
1275,I have received so many compliments on this top. LOVE IT. its comfy and well made. will be buying more colors!
1276,Top is just fun! Great fit. Quality materials and craftsmanship.
1277,Cute and sexy. Dangerous combo >:)
1278,Thanks! I like it. I might get another soon. Its comfortable
1279,Fits perfectly and came right on time!!! Cute and unique and extremely well made.
1280,"this top is awesome! only complaint is the strings are a bit short for me, but its nice that their not too long and get in the way or stuck on things"
1281,Communication was great and the bikini fit perfectly!
1282,i love this bikini top its so sexy!!
1283,"Great quality suit! Seller was good to work with, will be ordering from again!"
1284,Very attractive.  Good quality.  Will buy again.
1285,"Great fit, the cups are a bit strange though"
1286,I'm a 34D with fairly firm breasts for a 35 year old. It fits properly and I don't look like a sausage. I'm not a fan of lining/thin padding which I could easily pull out and I can put back in if I want to. Overall  no false advertising here. What you see is what you get. 🤗
1287,Size large still fits a tad small.
1288,"I can't remember ever feeling so confident and comfortable in a bathing suit - definitely not since having kids! These suits are flattering & beautifully made. Fully lined, quality fabric. Shipping was lighting fast. This is my go-to source for swimwear!"
1289,If I could give this swimsuit ten more stars I would. Excellent quality and construction. The fabric is thick and sturdy and everything stayed put when I was in the water. The cut is flattering and I have received tons of compliments about it!
1290,"Really great and quite adorable. I generally am a bit uncomfortable wearing really revealing swimsuits - so I had to scour a bit until I found this. 
nThe seller was really nice and quickly replied when I asked about express shipping and such; and it arrived quite promptly."
1291,I love this suit! It's my first one-piece swimsuit. I was not sure if it would suit me. But it fits perfectly and flatters my figure!! The material is of nice quality and comfortable. I really recommend this shop!
1292,This was my favorite suit. Very flattering and well constructed!
1293,I love the piece. Beautiful and the fabric is perfect. It's great. Overall was a wonderful experience. Great seller to work with.
1294,"I absolutely love it!   Professionally constructed and fits perfectly, thanks so much."
1295,Excellent quality and the fabric is very thick and good quality. The XS fits me perfectly. I am a US 0 and 1.65m tall.
1296,"I love Kooj! She is super fast with emails, shipping and everything else! I want to buy from her again! Communicates well, and is very pleasant to deal with! Thank you for the exchange and I am very happy with my swimsuit! All the best!"
1297,love love love! thanks so much! great piece and amazing quality.
1298,Swimsuit is very cute. Very good quality and came fast for a handmade suit. Thank you!
1299,"Great Swimsuit, fast shipping cannot believe how good the quality is!!! They are great and worth every penny!!"
1300,Beautifully made bathing suit!
1301,"Absolutely love this swimsuit. Fits perfectly, good quality, shipped fast. I love having a swimsuit that is stylish but also practical to wear at the beach with my little ones. I think I'm going to have to order another style from Kooj as well!!"
1302,"OMG! Suit is gorgeous and fits beautifully. Extremely well made, too! Will definitely be back soon :)"
1303,It is everything I thought it would be! Fits like dream ?? I can't believe it was here same week I ordered it!  Only good things to say.
1304,"A wonderfully made suit, and arrived very quickly. Received compliments on it the first time I wore it! The cup insertions are a bit of a necessity since it is a bit see through when wet. I was hoping I could wear it without, but no matter, I am still quite happy with it!"
1305,The suit is beautiful and fits perfectly. It's my favorite style!
1306,Fit perfect. Better than I hoped:)
1307,STUNNING!!! Beautiful piece of work.
1308,This is a great bathing-suit! I love it!
1309,"When I first got this, I had to send it back for a simple alteration to the bust (Always the hardest part to get to fit for me) and she sent it back quickly and it fits perfect! I didn't want to take it off when I tried it back on. She is super lovely and easy to work with, and next summer i'll probably be buying another one"
1310,Excellent bathing suit!!!! So perfect. Owner is kind and prompt.
1311,I received many complements when I wore this suit. It fit well and the materials were the right thickness not to be see through but not bulky.
1312,Super fast delivery and a well made great fitting bathing suit. Thank you!
1313,I've never owned a swimsuit that fit so well!
1314,"very well made and beautiful swimsuit!

1324,"Needed this for a trip.. was delivered fast and fit like a glove. Will definitely purchase again in more colors. Would recommend to anyone that's looking for sexy coverage :)

<3"
1325,"The bikinis I ordered were beautiful, fit well, and shipped and delivered on time.  Julia was very responsive, and she created a custom bikini made for my measurements.  La Knitteria is highly recommended!  Thanks Julia!"
1326,Very happy with my beautiful crochet bikini! Julia told me to pick a smaller size for my top and she was right! I can really recommend this shop and the waiting time is totally worth it💕 thanks Julia!
1327,"Maillot de bain très beau et je pense d’une bonne qualité. 
Je le souhaitais couleur taupe et je l’ai reçu beige clair...! Mais il est très beau. 
Merci"
1328,Love my crochet bikini! Super sexy on the beach and kept it's shape in the water.
1329,"I fell in love with this bathing suit while browsing Etsy. A couple weeks later the bikini  (size S) arrived and it was everything I wanted and more. I ordered my top with padding and I would recommend that you do the same. The only downside is that the bottom has no padding and it is not very durable with waves. Overall, I am so happy that I got this gem. I get compliments every time I wear it. I get at least two people asking me where I got it from. More than anything I am happy that this original piece was made ethically. 🤍"
1330,Love my new bikini! It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Excellent quality and attention to detail in how it was made. It looks great and doesn't loose shape in the water.
1331,"The material is perfect, I ordered top in M and it was too big and Julia was kind enough to immediately respond to me and send me an S. I love love love the bikinis, super sexy and the colour I ordered (blue) is just fantastic. 

Still impatiently waiting for my top, but I love the product and the customer experience! Would recommend!😊"
1332,Love this bikini so much! The quality is incredible and it shipped to me much quicker than I imagined it would. 😊
1333,i didnt get it yet
1334,"Perfect perfect perfect suit! I'm seriously so excited about this; thank you for such a unique and attractive bathing suit. Worth the wait, definitely."
1335,"I LOVED this outfit!! My favorite outfit I ever had!! It was so cute, form fitting, comfortable. I gave her my measurements and she nailed it!! I cannot express enough how happy I am and excited to wear it again! Yay!! If I ever need another amazing costume made I will trust her. It came in on time, I think even about a week earlier than requested. She's super responsive and reliable!"
1336,Hannah has hands of an angel. Her Chuckie Finster suit absolutely fits like a glove. And it was ship before the date i requested. I can't wait to use this outfit at EDC LAS VEGAS :) THANKS AGAIN HANNAH!!
1337,"It was chilly that day so I mixed the top from this and wore the bottoms under the chuckie skirt I got! Wawa, reptar and I were a big hit!! Thank you! And thank you for the fast easy communication and being able to send it on short notice upon request!"
1338,"Absolutely love this swim suit! Chuckie has always been my favorite Rugrat, and the swimsuit bottoms worked perfectly for my Halloween Costume! Can't wait for summer to arrive so I can swim in this suit :) very well made!!! Thanks again!"
1339,I love love it! So much! I'm so happy with this swimsuit. I can't thank you enough.
1340,Love love love this swim suit!!! Rocked it at the family beach trip and everybody loved it! Huge hit for a stellar 90s throwback! Rugrats don't call it a comeback lol 😘
1341,"I honestly don't know where to start but.. this shop is a blessing!

I last minute decided I wanted to do a Chuckie Finster cosplay for my upcoming photoshoot. I had only two weeks notice to order. I fully didn't expect that I could get the costume on time with it being custom made and thought I would have to wait til another shoot/event but I gave it a shot and sent TheGoodWitch shop a message stating my deadline after I ordered. 

My costume literally arrived 3-4 days after ordered. Unbelievable! And the quality is top notch and it fit perfect. I could not be happier! This is a shop I would no doubt visit and purchase from again.

Thank you Hannah! 

(I'll update with photos when I can)"
1342,Loved it! Used it as a Halloween costume.. but it’s even greater because I can wear it as a bathing suit for the summer time!
1343,Hannah is lovely to order from! She works with what you want. AWESOME with communication and is such a sweetheart. I wasn't super happy with my order and she offered to work with me to make me happy. Would order again with her in the future!
1344,Just received it is so amazing fits perfectly I absoutly love it I can't wait for edc17!!!! Thank you so much
1345,I ordered this outfit for Escape So Cal. I messaged Hannah to make sure that I would receive the item in time. She was EXTREMELY responsive and helpful. The product was very well made. Comfortable and fits perfect like a glove. I can't wait to wear this to Escape and show it off. Shipping was also super fast. Thank  you! I'll definitely be ordering again soon.
1346,SO perfect!
1347,Fits perfectly! I absolutely love it! Shipped even earlier than expected! Great quality and look! Would definitely look into buying other costumes/swimwear from this seller (:

1359,Fast shipping to the US from the UK.  Nice and cool beach cover up.
1360,Fabulous kaftan. Wore it last night with compliments from family.
1361,Beautiful colour and design and shipped very quickly.
1362,"I LOVE this swimsuit so much! I took it with me on my beach holidays and I felt beautiful and special wearing it :)
I must mention two things: the fabric inside the upper part is dark blue (so not like in the picture) and the swimsuit does not fit me perfectly. BUT I still love it a lot. Don't hesitate to contact Irit if you have any questions. She's really nice and answers all your questions and concerns."
1363,I'm so in love with this bathing suit! It's such a beautiful suit! It's a one piece but yet so sexy. I'm 5 foot nothing and I got a size 38 and it fits perfect.
1364,"Love, love, love this swimsuit! Finally got to wear it out today and received a number of compliments. Fits really well and is extremely comfortable. Irit is an awesome seller and her suits are very well constructed. I know this one will last me many summers to come and I couldn't be happier."
1365,"I ordered the camo and the red lace. Both are beautiful and well made. I was not sure about the sizing since I can wear anything from a small to a large depending on the brand, so I had to size up in the top and down in the bottoms. BonnyBikini helped me with sizing and made the exchange process a breeze! I'll be ordering from here again!"
1366,The colors are just stunning. The coral just pops in color! This is amazing cant wait for summer.
1367,"Just got my very first Bonny Bikini order today and I’m in LOVE!! The quality is amazing; the material is so soft and comfy and very well made.  The sizing is absolutely accurate which is awesome! I love knowing that my next order will fit just as it should. I’m in love with the pop of bright peach with the camo, and I love that my bikini will be unique in a crowd this summer! I couldn’t be happier! 🧡💚🖤"
1368,I absolutely LOVE this swimsuit! Seller was extremely helpful and super quick to respond to any and all of my questions! Very quick turnaround time! Will definitely be ordering more 🙂
1369,She loved it. She is DD on top and a Med on bottom. It was perfect. TY.
1370,I’m going to order like a million more suits from you! I love it! Bonny helped me pick the right size with quick responses and got my suit in about a week. Love it!
1371,Got so many compliments on this. I had also ordered the wrong size bottoms and they were so awesome about exchanging it for me!
1372,Orange and camo is the perfect combo for this! Fits perfectly! I love this shop!!
1373,One of my new favs!!!!

1388,"My daughter, age 12, absolutely loves her new bathing suit.  Great service and product!"
1389,Awesome suit! Fits perfectly and so cute! Comes to just the right place on the waist!
1390,Adorable as it can be
1391,Love it very happy i got a smaller size for my boobs it works wonderfully
1392,The seller did a great job altering the original order to my specification. Easy to work with.
1393,Love this bikini top. I'm super excited to wear it to the river this 4th of July. Great quality material and perfect fit.
1394,"Love this top thanks! Made really well and very flattering, quick delivery too."
1395,"Nice fit, good quality, great service."
1396,"Beautifully crafted and fits perfectly! The crocheted material is slightly malleable as well, so I can shape the cups to my body. So unique and well made :)"
1397,The delivery took a while (shipped on 27 March and arrived on 10 April) but I am really happy with the bikini. It's super cute.
1398,"I absolutely love it, it is so delicate and it's a fine work, the size is perfect also, very happy with this purchase!"
1399,mi è piaciuto  moltissimo  ottimo lavoro
1400,"Very beautiful piece.  Shipped on time.  
Love this bikini!  Thank you!"
1401,"This swimsuit was made so well. It is comfortable, it fits like a glove. I love how it offers changeable coverage. It also smooths and holds in a tummy. I would buy it if you have not yet. I took a lot of pictures as I played with styles but can only share one, it seems. My favorite way to wear it is with sleeves. I also like to wear it as bottoms with a flowy crop top."
1402,This is such a beautiful item! So pleased with it and the colour is stunning!
1403,"This swim suit is amazing!! I’m 5ft 11 so needed a swimsuit longer in the body, I emailed Elizabeth with my measurements to ensure it was long enough, when I tried it on it was a perfect fit! Friendly service, will be purchasing another one come pay day! You will be getting a custom swimsuit but also a quality service with Elizabeth!"
1404,Bought as a present and it's Gorgeous. I will be buying another for myself!
1405,"I am so in love with my set, I will forever order from her. She was super quick with responses to my questions, it only took a few days to make and shipping was super quick. The love put into this item is very visable, amazing quality. Thank you so much!"
1406,Looks exactly like the photo!! Wore it in the water and it's still in perfect condition. Beautiful thank you!!
1407,Obsessed!!!
1408,LOVE my new bikini top! Thanks so much <3
1409,Gorgeous! I love this bikini top so much!
1410,Absolutely love the bikini top I purchased! Looks and feels awesome ❤️ fits perfectly.
1411,Beautiful top and even better customer service! I am so excited to wear this on vacation next month.
1412,"Modifying - received crochet knit bikini from other shop that made me realize this one is poor quality. Though its cute, It's not stretchy and fits poorly. Waste of money"
1413,Shipped very quickly and love the bikini top I ordered!
1414,"Thank you for this really well-made piece. This may be the first piece of latex I have purchased, but I can clearly tell it was made with care and precision. 
The fit is perfect, it hugs the skin nicely throughout the whole length. All the 'seams' are cut precisely and are of constant width. The glue also seems to hold well. Aside from the slightly asymmetrically glued crotch zip, everything is perfect in terms of quality. 
The colour (transparent blue - T50) managed to surpass my expectations. It's so vibrant and pretty, even when not shined.

I'd really like to see women wear these kinds of swimsuits on a regular basis. It looks so good on a female figure. 

The price is very reasonable for a handmade product. I'd expect such a quality item to cost more. I'll be back to buy some more."
1415,"I'm a US size 12 (long torso, big butt), I ordered size XL. This fits great! Very sexy! Be careful though, I got a light translucent color and the clasp from the bra was wearing before stained the piece already :("
1416,Absolutely love it. They were able to make an adjustment to the leg holes and it is so beautiful!
1417,Amazing fit! Definitely worth the price. Will be ordering from them again!
1418,Amazing detail and fit!! The girlfriend loves it and it’s amazing!! Will be buying more soon!!
1419,"Everything OK. Good quality.
I will probably buy again in the future from this shop."
1420,This product is perfect! my darling love it!
1421,"Excellent. Reasonable price, great fit."
1422,"Très bonne qualité, épouse bien les formes jolie coupe"
1423,Item just as ordered.  Thanks and would use buyer again!
1424,"Fits perfectly, no tears and no trouble with the zipper. Has been worn 6 times since purchase."
1425,"I asked about delivery time before purchase, i was guaranteed it would arrive on time, when it did not arrive on time the person replying was rude and non helpful. i ordered this item for a filming production, which i had made clear before purchase, i was disgusted with the customer service and the responses i received from this seller. the item did not arrive on time for the production date and therefore caused a delay in filming. very disappointed."
1426,"this seller was fantastic. the set fit perfectly (although i'd recommend sizing up your bottoms if you've got chunky curves like me), but after a thread malfunction during shipping which i first noticed while trying on the swim top, the seller immediately replaced the top for me at the speed of light. i am thoroughly satisfied and will absolutely shop here again! thank you rey for all the help! twistedglow FTFW!"
1427,"The swimsuit looks exactly as pictured and arrived on time. After receiving the black swimsuit (and testing it out at the beach), I went ahead and purchased the pink & leopard print set. 

My bust is 37 inches and found the D cup to show a slight gap between my top part of my bust line when I move around. I ordered a DD cup for the pink & leopard print and that size was a perfect fit. I believe the seller has a pretty lenient return policy, but I had already torn the tag off and worn the black top at the beach, so I didn't bother returning it for a better size. 

As mentioned in my review for the pink & leopard bikini set, I ordered the XL bottoms (waist 31"" & hips 37.5""). The bottoms aren't very cheeky but the fabric can easily be adjusted to make it cheeky."
1428,I love it! It fits great! Indefinite recommend and I just bought another piece from you!
1429,Got here fast and my gf's booty looks incredible in it haha
1430,"Super cute style, but the stitching ripped the first time I tied it on.  I never wore the bottoms, they were way to low in the front and not lined.  The cup size was way too big for my full size C.   It’s not made to swim in!!  It’s more like a “stripper” bikini.  Super fast shipping got in time for Punta Cana! But I will never wear it again 😢"
1431,"This seller is great. Answered questions quickly and had my item shipped immediately. It's a beautiful, sexy bikini. For me, the bottoms sit very low in the front. If you keep your hair down below, maybe reconsider the bottoms."
1432,"Shipped incredibly fast for clothing which was exciting, and it looks great! Only thing I dislike is the tags placement, but nothing some scissors can't help with, haha. Also came with a some LED finger lights which was pretty cool, as well!"
1433,"Seller was very helpful in answering questions, shipping was very fast. I typically wear a S/M in bathing suit bottoms and had to order an XL in these and it fit just fine so definitely review the size chart before ordering, these run super small."
1434,Fast shipment. Love the support the top gives. Bottoms are really small but i knew that when i was buying.
1435,Super cute bathing suit that fits great. Can’t wait to show it off at the beach.
1436,I'm usually a small/medium. I ordered a large and it's still tiny.
1437,"Not true to size, definitely order a size up when ordering. Material is nice but I won’t be able to wear it."
1438,"Exactly as described, and looks amazing on my fiancee. Store owner was very helpful in making sure I got the correct size."
1439,"looks exactly like it is pictured. fits well, although the top is a little too stiff, although that should go away with wear. thanks!"
1440,Got it super fast! Thanks.
1441,This suit turned out to be a little big but over all great bathing suit and fast delivery
1442,"So happy with our purchase! We decided to have an 80s themed bachelorette and these suits made the perfect leotards for a great price. Each suit had a different phrase and Nadejda custom fit each phrase to several different sized suits. She went above and beyond changing font size so everything looked perfect! The suits also fit great. I can’t speak to how they fit when wet, but the white is slightly see through even when dry. I suggest curvier or long torso women to size up. Thanks so much. The bride was thrilled 🤍"
1443,exactly what we wanted. size is mostly true to size but the straps/torso is long if you’re short.
1444,UPDATE- The seller reached out to me immediately to offer to send an alternate color. Great customer service!! Thank you it’s appreciated!!
1445,Great product but Definitely run small. I would suggest to order the next size up. But bathing suit is great material!
1446,"Very smaller than expected. Good quality, but should order a size or two up."
1447,Sizes dont match size chart. When i messaged her it took days for a response and she expected me to purchase another swimsuit. I dont even feel like wasting any more breath on the poor service. Wont shop here again.
1448,Had issues with the mail and shop gave refund
1449,"LOVE THIS BIKINI, got it for an anniversary trip, hubby loved it too!! The seller is amazing, super quick to respond, sent it way ahead of schedule, could not be happier! I was even a little crazy, changed some things around on her last minute, and she responded so quickly and kindly. Will definitely buy more from this shop! Thank you!!"
1450,"There aren't enough stars to rate this shop, they are absolutely amazing!! I'm a bikini junkie cause I live at the pool and I ran across this shop and fell in love with every one they had! So I immediately ordered 3 ! There was one that absolutely adores but the color wasn't right for me so I emailed sweet treats and asked if it was possible to have it made in a different color and they responded right away and fulfilled my request 😄 the bikinis arrived much sooner than I expected especially for a custom order and when they got here they were even more than I expected!! They're absolutely beautiful and so well made they were to die for!!! I loved them so much I got on their site immediately and there I ran across their loungewear line which was obviously to die for as well and ordered two jumpsuits! Customer for life!!"
1451,"Bought this for my GF and the bottoms fit well, the top is a little tight and where the string in the top attaches to the main piece it ruffles which doesn't look the best."
1452,Love!! Love!!! Love!!! Its the cutest bikini ever!! It looks exactly like the picture and is very well made.
1453,Great.  Thank you! Angela Cabral
1454,"Probably my fault for asking for no ""extra Padding"" as my DD doesn't need anything ""extra"", but ended up lacking structure. Fortunately, the design allowed me to put a light padded cup in and now it is beautiful. The seller also added a removable halter tie at my request. VERY accommodating seller. Will certainly recommend!"
1455,"I received my shipment the other day.  It arrived on the 10th of the month just like you said it would.  I got the bikini cover-up and the pink and grey bikini top.  They are beautiful, just like the pictures.

We are going on an Asia cruise in a few months and now my wife has some great beach ware to wear out at the pool.  My wife likes them so much I will probably buy the same bikini top in some of the different colors.

Thanks so much for your great service.  Maybe I will sent you some Pics!

Bob"
1456,"Soft, Beautiful, Everything I ever wished for!! Recommended :)"
1457,"I ordered a medium but it is so small it might cover my tush...maybe 😬
I’m only 5’1” so I thought a medium would be maybe a little MORE material, just in case, but its pretty small!"
1458,This top definitely needs padding. Dont love the way it fits.
1459,Beautiful quality I can't wait to use it...
1460,"Horribly thin material, no way this would be appropriate when wet. Do not order this product!"
1461,"Absolutely gorgeous bathing suit with soft, comfortable, and lush material. I will definitely be purchasing more bathing suits from this shop in the future!!"
1462,I love it. Thank You!
1463,soft and so comfy! Although it was a bit more orange than red
1464,"Item as described, thank you!"
1465,Loveee this bathing suit! It’s perfect for my bachelorette party at the beach. It’s good quality and super cute. Definitely get a size bigger than you think because I am typically a medium and the large fits me perfect.
1466,Was the perfect addition for my sister bachelorette! A little sheer in the back when it got wet but so sexy! She looked amazing
1467,Came quickly and the fit is perfect! The printed letters don’t bubble or stretch. Great product! I’m excited to wear it for my bachelorette in a couple of weeks ❤️
1468,"5'9, 200lbs...XL fits perfectly! So excited to wear this for my Miami Bachelorette Weekend!"
1469,I bought this for a Bachlorette party. I talked to the seller before hand about shipping and they were very accommodating. The sizing was perfect and the white was not see through at all. The bride was obsessed with the suit and wore it all weekend!!
1470,"Ordering this made me nervous, but I was so pleased with the quality and fit of this swimsuit! I'm a true large and it fit great :) can't wait to wear it on my honeymoon!"
1471,This is a super cute bathing suit but IT IS see through and runs VERY small. I got a medium and the chart told me that is my size but I could use a Large. I got this for my bachelorette party and I can't wait to wear it but do not think I can go in the water with this swimsuit.
1472,Great bathing suit for my bachlorette weekend! Wasn't see through and played it's purpose for the weekend. Can't wait to wear it during my honeymoon
1473,I have only tried on. But the fit is great and the suit is SO cute! Perfect for my bachelorette party. Can't wait to wear it!!
1474,"Love it! Good quality, but glad I ordered a size up."
1475,Really good quality!
1476,Cute bathing suit only complaint is that there is no liner and it's see through . I definitely wont be able to  wear this swimming but I'll at least look really cute sun bathing in it as a  new Mrs.
1477,Fit the bride perfectly! So cute!!
1478,"DO NOT ORDER WHITE!!!!!

Also, definitely get strappy. My 8 Bridesmaids got strappy and it's WAY cuter & fits better than the thick straps. I wish we bought them from a different seller.

I am 5’7” 125lbs 32DD - I ordered Medium.

My WHITE BRIDE swimsuit, is see-through, even when it's not wet. You can see every single little detail of your body. I can't imagine how bad it is when it is wet. May as well just be naked. It also gapes in the bust. The seller offers 65% refund if I mail back the suit and no other options. They recommended wearing shorts with it. (So not the point of a swimsuit). I will probably end up sewing in my own real swimsuit lining or dying the suit because I was given no other options from the shop (no exchanges & no apology). After shipping the suit back, I will have spent $25 and gotten nothing."
1479,"Cute, but a little see-through, especially in the back"
1480,The swimsuit is SOOOO see through and fits funny. I ordered the white bride one for my bachelorette party and don’t even think I’ll be able to wear it!
1481,Super cute! I can’t wait to wear it at my bachelorette party! 💕
1482,Great quality! Not see through!
1483,Good customer service with very speedy delivery.
1484,"Nice suit, I think the bride will enjoy."
1485,"Good suit- just not crazy about how it looks on me. Not the seller's fault. I ordered a large and it fits. (5'3, 160lbs, and 36DD) Also, gives me a ""uni-boob"" lol. Shop does say 2-3 weeks for production so order in time for your event. I will still wear this to my bachelorette party but probably with a cover up or cute shorts."
1486,Fits good but it’s too see-through.
1487,The actual suit is completely see-through
1488,"I washed this before I packed it for my trip. The writing rubbed off. Didn’t even get to wear it, and they won’t accept it for a return since the sticker was off and I washed it. Moral of the story, it is poor quality and will be ruined after 1 washing."
1489,"The material is extremely thin and see through. It took 3.5 weeks to get this suit from when I ordered it. I went off the sizing instructions and ordered one size up and it is way too big. The worst part is that this shop won’t let you return or exchange. I am disappointed. 

Spend your money somewhere else."
1490,"The torso is VERY short, so it's not very wearable as a bathing suit. Since you can't return it, I'll wear it as a top, but not what I was expecting. Pretty disappointing."
1491,Fast shipping and it’s not see through at all!
1492,"The quality is reasonable
However the fit was not the best. I tried to contact the shop, they said sale was final and they would refund me a few bucks to get an alteration at a local shop... but the refund never went though."
1493,"This swimsuit is 100% see through. Of course, I won’t be able to wear it and when I contacted to try to return they were rude. How can you sell a product that no one can use? WASTE OF MONEY."
1494,"The bathing suit in baby pink is not as depicted in the seller’s page. I was very disappointed when I received my order as I wanted a lighter pink for my bachelorette trip to Mexico in May. I addressed the issue with the seller before I even tried on the swimsuit because as soon as I saw it I knew I didn’t want it; but they didn’t offer any solutions. I decided to give it a chance and tried it on and it’s very see through. I tried over my underwear and you could see the colors. So yeah, this purchase was a waste of $30 dollars. Maybe I can donate it to someone who’s unafraid of showing body parts. We’ll see."
1495,"Came in good time, this bathing suit top looks amazing - it's really flattering! One star removed because the sewing is not perfect and the underside sticks out a bit, but it's not that noticeable and ironing helped. Thanks!"
1496,OHHHHH my new favorite top.  Once you figure it out LOL it's beautiful and the seller is top notch to deal with.  Thank you QUICK SHIP
1497,Absolutely love this seller! Great communication and quality suits! She answered every question I had very quickly. I'll be back soon!
1498,I love it!!! The fabric is so soft and amazing and it fits really well! I'm a 36D and got a large.
1499,"My favorite top! I have a larger chest and was really hesitant, but completely worth it. Great craftsmanship."
1500,"LOVE! Perfect fit!  I was hesitant ordering a suit online but this one is simply perfection. I'm 5' 9"" 140# got a small in the top and string bottom. Looking to order another set, small is perfect and m would probably also have worked if I wanted more coverage"
1501,I love this!
1502,Fits perfectly and true to size... I absolutely love it and would order from this shop again!
1503,The quality was better than expected and shipping was shockingly swift! I appreciated the thoughtful packaging and will definitely order from Berrin again:)
1504,This is my new favorite top!
1505,"Perfect top, quick shipping, great selller! My daughters only complaint is that when swimming she was exposed a time or two, she is small chested but it wasn’t secure for being active"
1506,PERFECT! Thank you :D Love how this makes my tits look bigger :D haha! Got compliments for it! Thanks!
1507,"Beautiful top, fast shipping, the owner of the shop really cares about her customers, she was there to answer all of my questions and concerns. 
Thank you"
1508,"Pas tout à fait à ma taille , je fais un 90E et le tour de taille est trop grand , sinon livraison très rapide ."
1509,"Item was perfect! Arrived quickly, true to size. I would order again!"
1510,"I love it! Very flattering, fits true to size, and arrived very quickly."
1511,"Cute and sexy, at first confusing to tie properly but eventually can figure it out. Not the most supportive of tops for the chest but certainly very sexy and worth it!"
1512,Beautifully made and quick shipping
1513,very helpful and fast shipping
1514,Love love love my suit. She was super great to work with and it was exactly my size ! She answered all of my 700 million annoying questions with pleasant responses! Can’t wait to order another
1515,"Lucy, I cant thank you enough for my wonderful bikini. I have never felt sexier in my life!!! I put it on last night and my son said ""Wow Mom, you look skinny!!"" That was the best feeling ever. I have lost 120 pounds and so finding a bikini I am comfortable in, is a HUGE deal to me... so thank you so much!!!"
1516,"Just got my Ruffle Bikini and I am IN LOVE! I ordered it in hot pink and it did not disappoint.  Communication to the seller was great, they were very polite. I received my suit in 5 weeks and it was totally worth it. I will defiantly be ordering from Lucy again!"
1517,Beautifully made amazingly fitted swimsuit!!! Amazing color super fast shipping! Love love love!!! AAAAAA++++++ =D
1518,"SO HAPPY!!!!! First of all, communication was spot on. All of my questions were answered (I had a lot of concerns because it is SO hard for me to find a top that supports me!) I needed my kini by a certain time, and she was able to get it to me 2 days early! I tried it on about an hour ago and JUST took it off now! It fits perfect. I could not be happier and already have in mind what I am ordering next!!"
1519,My bikini just came in the mail today and I absolutely love it! Greta fit and Lucy made sure I got it in time for my trip.
1520,"I ordered this swimsuit in purple and everything about it is perfect! This stitching is excellent and it fits me so well! I was actually a bit nervous that the scrunch bottoms would be a bit skimpy on me, but they look great! 
nSo many of my friends now want to order from Lucy Bea! I will definitely be ordering more in other colors!!
n
nIt took about 5 weeks to receive my swimsuit, which is very reasonable considering this is a custom piece. 
nI highly recommend ordering from Lucy Bea!!!"
1521,The fit was perfect and the suit is sexy and stunning.  Worth every penny.Thanks Lucy Bea.
1522,"I just got my bikini and it is amazing!  Not only was Lucy Bea great with responding back to me, she was able to get me my suit before my trip.  Usually it is very hard for me to find bikini's that fit just right (especially bottoms) but this will probably now be my favorite! PERFECT"
1523,"Although the suit took about three weeks to ship out it was well worth the wait! I LOVE the suit, it fits perfect and I can't wait to wear it!"
1524,I just recently got my etsy account and this was one of the first things I bought . I am so excited to wear it and show it off all simomer long:)
1525,It's absolutely perfect!
1526,"I received my bikini and I LOVE IT. I cannot wait to wear it. Lucy was extremely responsive and provided great customer service. I will surely come back to order more because of the positive experience and, of course, because her items are super cute!"
1527,Thank you... I loved my bathing suit.
1528,I'am so happy with my purchase. I love the fact that I was able to order a different size top and bottom to fit my body shape. Very happy customer : )
1529,"I LOVE THIS SUIT! I bought it in lime green. It fits perfectly and the color is bright and beautiful. My only complain about this experience would be that sometimes there was a lack of communication on the seller's end about shipping. I understand that this must be an incredibly busy time, but sometimes it would take days for her to respond. Apart from that, I love the suit and hope to purchase another in the future!"
1530,Love this bikini! Had many compliments!
1531,"Shipped exactly when the seller said it would.
Super cute! And decent quality!"
1532,It wasn't exactly the material I was expecting (it is a bit shinier than in the pictures) but it is really cute and fits very well! I will definitely be purchasing another!
1533,"love it so cute, I have 3 colors now!"
1534,"I like that it's comfy, and cute! i got a 12/14 which evidently is slightly big on me, but i can work with it. overall, it's a nice suit. thank you!"
1535,"I can't say enough good things about both the swimsuit and the seller. First, the suit is EXACTLY what I wanted. It's full coverage and well made. I got so many compliments. It hides all the right things and is still flattering. 

As for the seller, Lucy is amazing. Very responsive and kind. My first swimsuit got lost in the mail and she knew I needed it for a vacation. She made another by noon that day and sent it Express mail. It showed up at my doorstep the next day and I'm so thankful. I'll definitely be a repeat customer with this kind of customer service!"
1536,"Super cute! Love the top, especially. Very flattering!"
1537,"love it, thank you!!"
1538,"Love the swim suit... very cute, well made and looks just like the picture. The only problem was it took a month to receive it."
1539,My daughter LOVES her bright green bikini its sooo cute!
1540,Beautiful bathing suit thank you !
1541,"The product itself was amazing and I very pleased with it, but I did have a malfunction when it came to the shipping and receiving. I would order from this seller again though."
1542,Great bikini... provides full coverage and is so flattering! absolutely love it! Will be back sooner then later!
1543,Love it! Thanks!!
1544,"Super Fast Service! Fits perfectly, the maroon color is beautiful, love this bikini! :)"
1545,"Frustrated with many aspects of this purchase. I allowed plenty of time for creation and shipping and ended up having to contact shop to ask why I hadn't received my order yet as our vacation got dangerously close. Seller was slow to respond, but finally did and upgraded my shipping to overnight which I appreciate and therefore gave her 3 instead of 1-2 stars. The color is vibrant and beautiful and the fabric looks high quality. Seams were very noticeable and ended up making the suit appear poorly made. The top also offers very little support and doesn't really sit correctly on my ribcage.  Not what I'd expect for the price at all."
1546,Thank you!
1547,Love this swim suit so much I purchased two! Can't wait to purchase from this shop again. Great service and very accommodating.
1548,Love this swim suit so much I purchased two! Can't wait to purchase from this shop again. Great service and very accommodating.
1549,LOVE IT.  Thanks!!
1550,It's made well and fits great!
1551,"I'm very pleased with LucyBea, she responded to all my emails immediately and my order came in on the date that I needed it, I was so happy. I only wish the top had more support, maybe underwire or molded cups, because when I tie it around my neck to lift me up it starts to hurt because it's too tight and when I loosen it I don't have that support like a bra gives u. But other than that I LOVE my swimsuit, I recommend this seller and look forward to doing more business with her"
1552,"The top was actually coming apart. Sent it back and she fixed that section, but didn't fix the issue with the threading which was apparent in all of the items I ordered. Sad, because I sent it back and it still wasn't fixed. Had to ask after a month where it was. Only then was it immediately sent out. I really loved my first bikini, but the quality has take a nose dive."
1553,Love it! Will order more.
1554,I like the way that it's made and it fits well. My husband says that it's very sexy ?
1555,"I loved the top, but the bottoms did not fit correctly."
1556,"The swim suit is great.  But working with the owner was difficult. She did not do the shipping label properly, which delayed everything. And didn't notice it until I told her that she had not actually mailed anything."
1557,great communication. cool swimmers cant wait to wear them this summer! thank u
1558,Thanks for responding and resolving all issues!  I greatly appreciate it!
1559,The fit was good and the suit looked just as it did in the pictures.
1560,Shipped extemely fast - thanks!
1561,Material is not great or flattering
1562,"i ordered this swimsuit on April 6, 2013, and finally received it over a month after i had ordered it, after numerous emails to this company i finally heard back form them and they told me my shipping date was May 3rd... i didn't receive this swimsuit until May 28th, it was poorly made... looks very ""handmade"" the top has no padding in it and the lining was crudely cut and stitched on the fabric.. not very happy.
n"
1563,"I am highly disappointed in my experience with this shop. It took almost 2 months for my bathing suite to arrive. I emailed her three times and she did not respond and I only received the suite after I opened a case. She never once responded to apologize. When I finally received the suite, the top is not for a D cup that I ordered! It is more like an A/B cup. I have contacted her to exchange, we'll see if she responds. I urge you ladies to think twice before making a purchase!!!"
1564,"Fit was perfect, size chart really helped, and the material is high end. 

Comfiest bottoms I own now & perfect for spring break (;"
1565,Super cute! I ordered the white and it didn't stain when I was brushing against boulders to take a water fall picture. I will order more.
1566,"Well made bikini bottoms. They look really good on and  fit perfectly. The straps on the side are soft enough that they don't cut into your hips, so no awkward little muffin-tops, yay! Really happy with them :)"
1567,Super cute bottoms and they fit great and are soo soft!! Nice moderate coverage that shows a little extra without your whole booty hanging out! Love it!
1568,"Love Love Love!! Fits very well, so cheeky! And so comfortable!"
1569,Super duper sexy
1570,Love these bottoms!!
1571,Seller tailored the order to my request in a timely manner.
1572,"Did ship on time, never received it because I entered the wrong apartment number and my nabour got it but swore they hadn´t seen it..... Looks nice on the picture though, shame I f-up the order.."
1573,"This was suuuch a cute one piece swimsuit for my Bachelorette Party trip in Pensacola Beach, FL. It shipped on time and it fit perfectly! Lori was very helpful with making sure it would fit."
1574,"LOVE LOVE LOVE; from customer service, the quality of the swimsuit, the design, just everything, I highly recommend, and I cannot wait to wear it on my honeymoon; thank you so much. The seller was amazing and communicated very well from the day I made the order."
1575,"I absolutely LOVE this swimsuit!!The material is high quality ,Gold and white are gorgeous colors that go perfectly together!! Can't wait to wear it on my wedding!! Lori was a pleasure to work with and was very helpful and approachable with questions- thank you! Will definitely be coming back :)"
1576,"Love love the Bride Swimsuit got for my friend to wear on her bachelorette party and honeymoon.  She is going to love it!!!

The swimsuit is so well made and even has padding cups!

Thank you!!!"
1577,"The swimsuit is high quality and exactly what I was looking for. I am ecstatic with the outcome! But what stuck out the most was the OUTSTANDING customer service Lori had. From beginning to end she was professional and helpful. The ordering process was seamless. She worked with me directly, messaging me back and forth until we had the perfect suit design. She continued to work with me until the swimsuit was absolutely perfect. I truly have never had a better customer service experience. The product was worth every penny. 

THANK YOU LORI! You are truly talented!"
1578,"Fits so well and beautiful. Highly recommend, I will definitely be ordering again!"
1579,"This is super cute swimsuit. Just wish it was a darker, more vibrant print. It's not as bright as it looks online."
1580,Love the bathing suit.... Did not realize the wording was not actually glitter/sequin but that's my own fault.
1581,"I absolutely love these bottoms!! They turned out to be a little more thong-y than the picture in the listing, which made me super nervous. But they ended up fitting perfectly and I got a ton of compliments. I'll definitely wear these a ton this summer! I'm the one on the left, and I'm also wearing the matching top that I ordered. Comfy and flattering, thank you! More orders from this store are in my near future :)"
1582,"Love my new bikini bottoms! They fit perfectly and I feel so sexy in them! The seller was so awesome about sending them out early so I got them in time for my trip to Vegas, so appreciative! Such cute packaging as well!"
1583,"Omggg it finally arrived! I was getting pretty worried because i ordered it from S.Korea and the tracking stopped  after it left Honolulu! But the seller was super nice about everything. I ordered the color #8 Mauna Kea Blue color, which is a bit different from what I expected but still so pretty! It has more green tone than the picture i took. I usually wear size 6-8 but 6 wasn't available so I messaged the seller. The size is still a little big for me, so i have to pull the sides up a little, which makes it look more like a V shape than the picture. If the shipping was faster and didn't cost as much, I would've ordered another color in a smaller size, but i guess i don't have much choice bc i need them by next week. Anyways, the bikini bottom is super sexy and comfortable. Will purchase again from her!"
1584,"I just received today. Love bikini so much, I just placed an order for another one! Great value for a cute, cute suit! Seller was so helpful and allowed me to make a change after submitting original order (thank you!). Glad I sized up, this is great."
1585,The bikini is amazing! There was a slight mix up in sizing but the owner of the shop worked with me to get a size exchange and my new bikini fits great and is beautiful! Thank you Kukui Bikini!
1586,Love the orange color I chose!! The fit is great and comfortable!! This is my 3rd bottom to purchase and they’re all amazing. ❤️
1587,"Love love love these bikini bottoms! Stretchy, comfortable and very flattering. Also the pattern is really cute and can match with any black bikini top. Thanks Annie for a really great bikini!"
1588,Good quality material and super cute prints!! They do run a little small. I usually wear a small/medium cheeky bottom so I ordered a medium and they were too small. But I was able to exchange them out for a large and they fit perfectly!!
1589,"Seller was able to ship what I wanted very quickly. I am right at 39"" so I ordered a large but they are a bit snug on me. If you're right on the cusp, I would suggest ordering the next size up."
1590,I will ordering more ! Before the summer ! Exactly what i wanted and they are so perfect
1591,A great combination between a regular cheeky and thong bikini! Super easy to wear above the hip or straight across. I’ve only been wearing these bottoms to the beach.
1592,Fits like a glove and in just the right places. Amazing price for this type of style! I would totally purchase another.
1593,"It's a very secure bottom, great for surfing or snorkeling. Runs a little small though, so if you're a size 2 I'd recommend getting a small vs. x-small."
1594,"My husband loves these on me! While it did take a little while to receive them, we are very pleased with the fit, cut and look of these bikini bottoms!!  Very nice!"
1595,"My husband loves these on me! While it did take a little while to receive them, we are very pleased with the fit, cut and look of these bikini bottoms!! Very nice!"
1596,Love them! They fit perfectly!
1597,Awesome fit! Love the print!
1598,"Very nice bottoms! Definitely cheeky - could probably call them a large thong. But they look great, are comfy and vendor is very helpful."
1599,Very accurate size chart. Well made and fast shipping. Looking forward to wearing this on my honeymoon:) thank you!
1600,Fit perfect❤️ loved the material.
1601,Very attractive.  Good quality.  Will buy again.
1602,Great fit. Very Good Item. My girlfriend loved it.
1603,second time i've ordered from this shop and they never fail to exceed my expectations :)
1604,Fits great! Can't wait to wear it out.
1605,"I have never seen a crochet bikini this beautiful, that being said I have had many crochet bikini's in my life and this by far blew my mind. I will definitely be purchasing from here more often. I am so blessed to have this piece and another gorgeous one. Thank you so much you exceeded my expectations. Now I can go brag on the beach about my awesome bikini's."
1606,"Me ha encantado, me queda perfecto, justo como lo imaginaba, además Dragana es un cielo, se ha portado super bien, se nota que teje con amor, muchas gracias Dragana!

I love it! Thanks Dragana for your time, it is Fantastic!"
1607,I absolutely LOVE this bikini. It was worth the long wait❤️ it looks exactly like the picture and is a perfect fit. Couldn't be happier💚
1608,"I had to change my review after receiving my swimsuit in the mail today, at first I was irritated at how long it took but I don't even care.... It fits perfectly and is so comfortable. I would wait another two months for another one. I am in love with it. Beautifully made!!"
1609,"Finally, the bikini came!:) There had been a few issues with customs in the UK, but Dragana was so helpful and offered to make a new bikini for me, then found the ""lost"" bikini and re-shipped it to another address for me! The bikini itself is exactly as imagined- I love it to bits and can't wait to wear it to the beach! Thank you"
1610,love it!!
1611,Perfect fit and beautifully made !!
1612,Fantastic quality and well worth the wait. A must buy!!!
1613,"Loved it , very worth buying."
1614,Very well made. Just as pictured.
1615,Haven't recieved this item yet
1616,"I’m in LOVE with this swimsuit!! Kerry was kind enough to customize the size for me (x-small bottom, medium top) and the quality is top-notch! I like that I can reposition the top pieces to be either more or less covering in the middle. I was worried it wouldn’t feel secure on top but if it’s tied tight enough then everything holds in place. It’s such a unique and cute design, I will definitely be ordering more. Also, Kerry is just wonderful, she‘s a joy to work with! Highly recommend all around :)"
1617,The product corresponds to the picture and the size is the same than in the regular size in the store. Great product ! Great designer !
1618,"So happy with this swimsuit !!
Fit perfectly and the quality is here ! 
Entirely satisfied, I highly recommend !"
1619,"Would absolutely recommend again and again. When I received my original order I absolutely loved the style and make but the size was just a pinch too small. Kerry happily exchanged the sizes and went above and beyond helping me figure everything out. She is the absolute sweetest person and most important, her suit exceeded my expectations in quality and fit."
1620,"Shipped quickly, high quality and fits great. Was scared buying a bathing suit without trying it on but sizing charts provided were accurate and I love my new suit!"
1621,"Lovely bathing suit, super flattering and comfortable. I’m shocked as to how secure the top is, I haven’t been too worried about wardrobe malfunctions or anything. The owner is lovely, will definitely be looking out for other colours that catch my eye!"
1622,Great purchase! it fits perfectly. there was a little issue with the shipment since i live in Tahiti (an island very far from anything) but the shop owner was able to find a solution in no time.
1623,"I could go on for days as to why you should just buy this but I'll make it short. Fabric, style, comfort, everything about this swim suit is beyond perfect. I am 135 pounds and 5'6. The Medium fits perfect and is stretchy. It's sexy yet classy. You can open the front to show cleavage or close it to be more modest. Also the shop owner is by far hands down the best person I have ever had the pleasure to work with. She responded to all my questions with detailed responses. She takes pride in her work and it shows. She went over and beyond for me. This suit is hotter than hot girls. It will easily be the best purchase you have ever made."
1624,I feel so sexy and comfortable in this swim suit! I was pleasantly surprised at how secure it feels. I was afraid I would constantly be pulling or tugging to make sure my girls don’t slip out but that isn’t the case. Money well spent! I’ll post pics after my honeymoon
1625,"Perfection! Ordered the M long and so glad I did as the fit is perfect. I only have a slightly longer torso so, if you do, I recommend going long. It's a beautiful suit. Thank-you!"
1626,"Super chic retro fit! I’m curvy and it holds my stomach in while accentuating all the right spots In the bust, hips and butt. My husband loved! And so do I. ;) My coworker who is tiny, basically opposite body type of me, got and also loved! Perfect for all type!"
1627,CALLING ALL TALL BABES- this suit is amazing! I got this in a tall (i'm 6ft) and it is more than long enough (I could see this fitting women much taller than me) and it is still proportional to my body.  The material is very nice and it covers my chest completely- holding everything in securely (I'm a D cup).  Highly highly highly recommend
1628,It’s SOOOO CUTE!!! I love it ♥️♥️♥️
1629,I am in awe of this beautiful swimsuit! Great service in every aspect.
1630,Really a beautiful bathing suit and very flattering fit!
1631,"Suit fits a tad different on me than the model but non the less, quick delivery, fast responses when I asked questions and I LOVE it! Thank youu"
1632,Unfortunately I had to return it because it just didn't look good on my body shape. But I can definitely vouch for the quality. And the seller was very nice and helpful with the return.
1633,This swimsuit was exactly as I imagined but better! Great quality and fit. I will definitely purchase another!
1634,"Haven’t had a chance to wear it yet, but I have several of these suits and always get compliments on them."
1635,"Thank you, beautiful colour and fabric"
1636,Great customer service and the bathing suit is adorable. I haven't been able to wear it at the beach but I look forward to it.
1637,"So cute, fast shipping and great customer service"
1638,Absolutely gorgeous and well made. I can't wait to wear this on vacation!
1639,"Absolutely lovely suit! Seller was a pleasure to deal with, very helpful!"
1640,The most comfortable and flattering suit I have ever worn. I can't get enough!
1641,Not what I expected!
1642,Very nice suit and speedy delivery!
1643,This will easily become one of my favorite suits - I love it so much I want to order a second one in another color so hopefully it's still available!
1644,Muy contenta con la compra. Es como en la foto. Todo perfecto. Lo recomiendo
1645,I love it!! The most beautiful bikini I've had so far.
1646,Awesome Bikini!  Very Accommodating Shop.  Thank You!
1647,Absolutely in love with it!!
1648,Amazing! will be my summer love!
1649,Wrong size..... XS is like a M
1650,"Simple, but gorgeous, very well made and delivered so fast! Thanks so much 💖"
1651,"Lovely material, very tight, i absolutely need lube to put it on but it fits like a glove!"
1652,"Je suis très déçu par la qualité du produit.Vu le prix ,je 
m'attendais à plus de matière pour ce maillot qui est vraiment très fin et beaucoup trop petit pour une taille XL
Dommage  !!!"
1653,"Perfect size, high latex quality, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. Thank you very much, I'll come back :)"
1654,"Fit like a glove, durable yet stretchy enough to get on with ease, and so incredibly sexy once it's all shined up. This shop is easily one of the most affordable high quality latex shops out there."
1655,"Great quality, well designed. Exactly as described. I asked the shop for an open crotch and for a small fee they happily put it in, quick communication!"
1656,So perfect! Got this in red and I paid for fast shipping so it arrived so quickly!
1657,I'm really surprised with quality. Great user experience with customer service. And fast delivery.
1658,The swimsuit is fantastic and looks exactly as described. I love it. I will purchase again.
1659,"Perfect as usual, thank you!"
1660,Beautifully manufactured. It was a long travel from there to here but was worthy.
1661,"IT WILL NEVER ARRIVE! I ordered the package 3 months ago, it did not arrive and the seller does not want to give me a refund."
1662,"Culotte pas assez couvrante à mon goût... C'est dommage, je ne porterai que le haut et je passe le bas à quelqu'un d'autre ! Très jolie couleur par contre, et les détails sont bien finis ! Livraison rapide et créatrice à l'écoute ! Je met 4 étoiles à cause du bas mais je recommande complètement !"
1663,"Article conforme à la description, très bonne qualité et surtout très jolie ! 
Reçu rapidement. 
Vendeuse très agréable et à l’écoute, je recommande ! 
Seul petit bémol pour ma part, la culotte est légèrement petite.. 
Merci beaucoup !"
1664,"Superbe travail ! Le bas du maillot reste toutefois un peu petit et ne couvre pas assez mais il est magnifique, je le porterai quand même :) Christine est une super vendeuse très à l'écoute et très sympathique, je recommande ses travaux et sa boutique les yeux fermés ! Merci :)"
1665,Christine est au petit soin avec ses clients. Merci beaucoup!
1666,"Maillot de bain vraiment splendide!
La qualité est à l'image de la gentillesse et de l'écoute de Christine. Je recommande vivement cette boutique et ne manquerai pas de lui commander de nouveaux articles!"
1667,Très beau maillot de bain très bien fini!!
1668,Je suis très contente du résultat. Fabrication et livraison rapide :)
1669,"Joli maillot de bain mais je trouve que le fil de coton est un peu gros ce qui fait que le bas est un peu lourd.
L'article a été envoyé très rapidement, je suis contente de mon achat."
1670,"Maillot parfaitement (et rapidement) confectionné, tout à fait ce à quoi je m'attendais, avec en prime une grande amabilité !"
1671,L'article correspond tout a fait a ceux a quoi je m'attendais.. je recommande vivement cette créatrice qui est aussi talentueuse que sympathique..
1672,Le maillot est parfait et bien taillé. Merci !
1673,"Très joli maillot de bain couleur bleu lagon.
Envoi rapide et soigné.
Merci pour votre réactivité 
Magali"
1674,"It looks just like the picture! Tie back is ideal that's why I picked to get this! I forgot the font type and even though it was my fault and the seller could have had reason for delay, I still got this on time for my trip & she communicated with me often!! Thank you! Have a great holiday weekend next weekend! I'll be enjoying my bachelorette beach trip in my new top with my married initials ♥️💍🌊👙"
1675,I love this bathing suit top! This place did a fantastic job! Thank you!
1676,"The monogram came out adorable and is well done. Beware- this top is very narrow. I ordered the large and it is cutting it close on this one. I'm normally an extra small/small shirt or a medium/large bikini top. It has nothing to do with the shop, it's just the way the top is made. I'm really pleased with the monogram, though and will definitely purchase from this shop again!"
1677,Love it! Thank you so much! (: The pink one matches my Lilly P bottoms perfectly!
1678,It was a great product! So real and the seller gets in touch with you very quickly. Very good price as well! Would definetly purchase from this shop again! Shipping took a little while longer than I expected though.
1679,Very cute but sizes run small! Got a medium but it was only a 34B. And the first time it did not come with straps. Had to reorder but comes extremely fast and is very cute!
1680,I love my monogrammed bathing suit top and can not wait to wear it on my honeymoon!! Thank you!
1681,Arrived very quickly.  I love it!  I get so many complements on this top!
1682,love it!
1683,"Love love love. It fits perfectly and the monogram is beautiful. Fast shipping too! I can't wait to wear it, thank you!"
1684,A little brighter than I thought. More pinkish than coral but love the monogram. Thanks!
1685,Wonderful! The monogram was great and it looks so pretty!
1686,I loved this product my monogram looks so great and I would definitely recommend this to anybody who wants one !
1687,"Cute as can be.  Excellent quality. Fasty shipping, great communication.  Would purchase from again!!"
1688,Love it! Thank you so much (:
1689,It's a little smaller than I thought it be but it looked great!
1690,"I loved it. I should have bought the bottoms also.
Super cute❤️"
1691,Fast shipping! Monogram looks great!
1692,The top is cute and I can't wait to wear it on my honeymoon. Just keep in mind the top isn't very wide. It works for me because I have smaller boobs but may not work for someone with larger ones.
1693,"Very cute, good quality! Shipped fast!"
1694,Came extremely quick! Love it!!
1695,Perfect!! Thank you so much! Super fast shipping! LOVE
1696,Absolutely beautiful and well made
1697,I like them but the strap holders were broken on mine!
1698,So cute!! Cannot wait to wear it!! Thanks!!
1699,Fast shipping. Monogram looks great! Thank you!
1700,Very cute and helped with sizing!
1701,Looks adorable and arrived quickly!
1702,Soooo cute... Can't wait to wear!
1703,Exactly what I ordered. Can't wait to wear it!
1704,"nice quality, shipped on time"
1705,"Unfortunately this item didn't work for me. The quality of the garment was not up to par and the resulting fit was poor, and you just don't know when you order something online like this.  There are many swimsuit tops in my size, so I know I'm not difficult to fit. In this case, though, the item could not be returned because it was personalized, so in the end I'm out the money and the top.  Booh, because I really wanted to like it!"
1706,"The bathing suit top is very cute, unfortunately all colors do NOT fit the same.  I asked for the measurement , then Ordered two colors...having no idea that they wouldn't be the same.  One is much smaller and does not fit at all.  When I sent a message to the seller, I never got a response..... Very disappointing"
1707,"Highly unsatisfied. Sent the wrong size, which was her mistake not mine. Not going to wait an extra couple weeks to get it fixed. Won't be ordering here anymore."
1708,"Absolutely perfect! 💕 So in love with the color. I got Pacific Blue. Fits perfectly and is so well made! Xoxo She is the sweetest! Sent the wrong suit at first but informed me before it got her and had my suit on the way, right away. Sent me the slip to send back. Very smooth and fast shipping! Will definitely buy from again! 😙💙"
1709,"This seller went above and beyond to help me get the right fit, i am so grateful. Their hand work is exquisite and very artfully done. Thank you for the beautiful bikini!"
1710,"A little skimpier than I was expecting, but excellent quality. I've had several people comment on how well it is made (and how well it fits!) I'm just going to have to be a little more diligent about keeping fit :D"
1711,Loooooved my bikinis!!!  So well made and beautiful!!!  Amazing shop!!!
1712,I love these bottoms! They are the perfect amount of cheeky and they make me look so tan. Great quality too!
1713,fits perfectly! Very high quality
1714,Good fit! Just the right amount of cheeky. Quality is great!
1715,Super heureuse de mon bikini car il correspond déjà à la photo et il est vraiment de très bonne qualité. Car heureusement j'ai trouvé votre boutique et une autre super car j'avais commandé plusieurs bikinis car certain était en plus pour offrir et bien la catastrophe.
1716,Love these connectors well made and really satisfied with my purchase
1717,Beautiful!
1718,Perfect fit!
1719,This is a well made Gorgeous suit ! Thank you *
1720,"I love this swimsuit! I added some flesh-colored cups to the bra top to give me a little more coverage, but it fits perfectly and is so unique and fun."
1721,"Gorgeous Swimsuit, I really like that there are no ties or clasps. I just need to do some squats to really feel good wearing the bottoms. We had an issue with shipping but Liliya was super helpful and responsive. Two thumbs up!!"
1722,"just an amazing suit, such a perfect fit, so well made, and wow really sexy!"
1723,Sexy! Sexy! Sexy! Exactly as pictured- sizing good.
1724,Amazing! Needed it for a bachelorette party and even accommodated my shipping needs as I tend to do things last minute! The best!
1725,"The entire shopping experience with Maryam was beyond 5-stars! She was super helpful answering all questions for my entire ""squad"" and SUPER prompt answering my messages. Would recommend to anyone! I would also recommend going a size up. I was between the medium and large and happy I chose the large. Overall, EXCELLENT experience!"

Would recommend to anyone! I would also recommend going a size up. I was between the medium and large and happy I chose the large. Overall, EXCELLENT experience!"
1727,Awesome suits! Well made and very cute. The shop owner was so helpful with my large quantity order of suits for my sister's bachelorette weekend! She was able to send out the suits immediately and I had them in hand less then a week after my order. The bride squad is now officially ready for pool days!
1728,"A group of us ordered these suits for a cruise and we absolutely love them! I was worried about the fit since I have a large chest and a small waist, but the seller was extremely patient and informative. It has amazing coverage up top for me, and the back being semi cheeky was just what we wanted. I highly recommend this product!"
1729,"When I first ordered the swimsuit, I’ll admit I was a little nervous. But when I tried it on not only did it perfect but the material felt amazing on my body. It didn’t itch or give me any issues. I love my swimsuit and will definitely be ordering more ! :D"
1730,I absolutely love my crochet top! I wore it to a music festival last week and couldn't stop getting compliments on it! My chest is usually too big for crochet tops but Shelly was very deliberate about getting all my measurements correct so it fit me like a glove! It's perfect for a festival that I'm not restricted by the cuffs and can move my arms freely while dancing. I actually saw a girl with a similar top and stopped her and we figured out we both got tops from this shop and it was a really cute moment. She was killing it as well! You can tell Shelly took a lot of time and effort to make such a quality piece of crochet. You're paying for it to fit you perfectly and last a long time. Shelly was also really great with communication back and forth about sizing and what not. Highly recommend this shop and product :)
1731,"Such a perfect fit and perfect top! I can't wait to rock it at Coachella and any future tropical trips I take! Thank you so much, Kayla! 😁"
1732,"AMAZING quality, so worth the wait, fits perfectly and is even more adorable than I had hoped!!!!"
1733,"Such a perfect, flattering fit!"
1734,"Beautiful peace, only giving 4 stars because processing time is very long, I recommend contacting seller for sizing because the material is not stretchy, I normally wear an XS and seller recommended S and it's a perfect fit!"
1735,"This top was worth the wait. It covers well, while being adjustable for size. It is a really cute design. Thanks for EVERYTHING"
1736,Shelly is amazing ! Shipped in a timely manner as promised and responds quickly. Product is amazing as well and fits perfectly
1737,thanks so much. loved wearing this red top for christmas! thanks for shipping it in time.
1738,Very cute! Nicely made! Shop owner very accommodating and polite;)
1739,Absolutely perfect. Making all my goth beach dreams come true!!
1740,Fit perfectly! Bottoms were a bit big but I love it!
1741,The seller was very professional and helpful. I absolutely love this suit. The quality and fit is amazing.
1742,Absolutely love it!!! Perfect size an good quality
1743,"First I was never updated on shipping as a matter of fact it still says item has not shipped, it arrived 3 weeks ago! I noticed it did not ship from the location it states in my order, it's from China. The cups have poor stitching, not straight at all, white thread hanging all over, and the padding was placed in backwards so they pop inwards instead of out. Needless to say the top is ok. The bottoms are great! Exactly as seen. Double stitching on the seams. A few threads. It is thin material but with the print it won't be noticeably see threw. I seen a lot of great reviews on this but its from China and not Az,  so quality could be questionable and probably won't last too long depending on how it's cared for."
1744,"Come on time, exactly as advertised.. good Material, I'd order again for sure"
1745,"Came on time, and looks amazing"
1746,Arrived quickly! Very pleased with purchase
1747,Bathing suit fit perfectly and was so cute for our Bachelorette party! I sized up and got a Large which I was really happy about. I’m 5’4” 135.
1748,"Fit perfectly! Looks great, love"
1749,I love this bathing suit!! It is so cute! Love the low back cut out. I just wish it had some type of padding in the top area. But overall I cannot wait to wear it on my bachelorette party in Vegas this weekend!!!!!(:
1750,This bathing suit is gorgeous and fit amazingly on everyone !!! I paid for expedited shipping and it was delivered within a week !!! Highly recommend these suits and would definitely buy them for any bachelorette!
1751,This is the best fitting bathing suit I have ever bought. It was designed perfectly how I asked and they even reached out because a color was no longer in stock but they were fast and efficient about letting me know and getting me the suit I wanted. I will most def be coming back and shopping here! LOVE.
1752,This is the best seller. I got what I dreamed of. The product is of the highest quality. I'm extremely happy. They sent it off very quickly. Recommended. In the future I will cooperate with this seller. You are a chance !!!!!!
1753,Yes! Perfect Item for my girls. Thank you
1754,YAS Can't wait to give to my Bridal Party members.
1755,So cute! Fits perfectly. Need some petals to cover nips as there isn’t padding!
1756,"White bride bathing suit fit perfect, true to size. Material was lined and was not see through, good quality!"
1757,"The suit is very cute and fits great, but the white is see through. I'm wearing it under shorts and planning to add swimsuit liners to the top somehow, so I'll make it work.. just be aware! Otherwise, the seller was easy to work with and the suit was shipped quickly."
1758,Love love love item. Exactly what I wanted Seller was very communicative. Nailed it!
1759,Quality work and awesome fit!!!!
1760,I love the look and feel of this bathing suit and it arrived on time as I requested. Thank you JMTboutique. I will be purchasing from you in the future.
1761,White a little see through but very cute! Can’t wait to wear it for my bachelorette
1762,Great suit. Only advice is to order a size up.
1763,Not true to size!! Waste of money.
1764,Swimsuit was good quality but white was see through. No refund. Read the T&C’s
1765,"I LOVE this bathing suit, so cute! Im 5'1 and about 120 lbs, but I we are a size D bra so I got a medium. It fits perfect. I got yellow which is a little see through but not too bad. My friends each got one of the other colors and they came to great also. High quality- I would definitaly  purchase again."

1777,It fit perfect 😍 I’m in love with this!
1778,Fits perfectly! I am 5'1 and was worried about it  being too high cut but it is not at all! Quality seems great (I have not yet worn it in the water) and I love the back - it dips nice and low but not too low.
1779,"This suit fit me perfectly. I am 5’7 and 150 lbs, muscular build. I ordered a small and it fits true to size. I am even a little more busty up top and it was fine. I got the red suit that says ‘Final Fiesta’ for my bachelorette party! I am so excited to wear it. I will say the quality could be a little better, but you get what you pay for. This suit will be worn 1-2 times, so I wouldn’t recommend buying this for a ‘normal’ swim season, as I don’t think it would hold up! Just from what I can tell by the fabric. (That’s why I have 4 out of 5 stars) I will say this seller was very easy to talk to and answered all my questions I had prior to my order!"
1780,"Fit a little small in the booty and loose in the shoulders, but I loved it anyways. Looked great for my Bass Academy outfit"
1781,The bathing suit fits great! The lettering came out good also.... there’s a little extra spacing between two letters that shouldn’t be spaced but it’s not that big of a deal. Overall I give it 4/5 stars! Will definitely order again!
1782,Great quality suit. The fabric is thick and the cut is great. I got a large and I’m 5’3” 150 lbs. fits great!
1783,"These bathing suits are THE BEST purchase you’ll make!!! They fit extremely true to size and come in a variety of colors. I needed 10 bathing suits, and the seller was able to accommodate me on a deadline as well. Highly recommend!!"
1784,"Cute suit I sized up for pregnancy, but they’re true to size! Order came in 2-3 weeks."
1785,Perfect for my bachelorette! Thank you!
1786,Great quality! true to size. Going to order more! Thanks!
1787,These suits came out so cute and were delivered in great timing!
1788,Exactly what we wanted! Thanks! Great item!
1789,Exactly what we wanted! Thanks! Great item!
1790,Exactly what we wanted! Thanks! Great item!
1791,Exactly what we wanted! Thanks! Great item!
1792,Came in quickly and they were great!!
1793,Awesome love it!!!! Fits great and going to be even better or VEGAS WOHOO
1794,It fits well and is going to be perfect for the bachelorette party I’m wearing it to
1795,Very fast service!! Love both of my suits
1796,Perfect! Not lined and came in about 3 weeks time.
1797,Very well made! Love it and can’t wait to wear it in Florida. Highly recommend!
1798,"So great! Got a white one and it was not see through. Loved the writing, letters came with a great size."
1799,They run extremelyyyyy small! And feel cheapy!
1800,Size ran smaller than I thought but will work for this one occasion
1801,"Didn’t ship on time, ordered 1-2 day shipping for an extra $40 & received it a week later than the expected shipping."
1802,"Didn't fit...make sure you measure yourself prior to ordering. Do NOT go by the sizes or you will be disappointed as well. When I contacted the seller, they were unwilling to fix resolve the issue."
1803,Unfortunately it’s not flatering. I want to love it but it fits awkward and I guess because I’m tall I should have gotten a large? Bummed because it was custom for my bachelorette. The arm straps wont lay flat either.
1804,Absolutely no support!  Not for full bust women.
1805,VERYYYYYYY DISAPPOINTED NEED A REFUND ASAP
1806,Love it!  Fits perfectly to my measurements ♥️
1807,"I adore this suit! The color is rich, shiny, royal blue. The custom fit is just as requested. It works for people that need hard-to-find cup sizes, and mismatched size for top and bottom, like me. However, if you're not used to the ruched bottom, it might fit a little smaller than you're used to. It's pretty cheeky. Maybe order a size up on the bottom so you don't have any bum cleavage :) Thank you so much!"
1808,"LOVE my suit. Seller was great with communication and accommodating to me needing this in a short time. Not only did it make it in time, it was worth the wait! Fits perfectly for my Disney vaca and I've already received multiple compliments. Will definitely order again!"
1809,I love my Suit!! Thank you Lucy
1810,"Lucy Bea is so talented, creative and accomodating. I don't know if I will ever shop in a department store for a swim suit again as long as she is still running her business and providing a swimsuit line. I seriously have never found a better fit!!! Thanks Lucy Bea... you are the best!"
1811,"I love this so much! It is flawless thank you thank you! I'm skeptical about ordering anything online much less a swim suit!! The ties are perfect so that the suit conforms to your shape exactly how you want it. Color is just as imagined and ruffled are beautifully done. And it's so soft! I wasn't expected such a high quality material. Thank you so much, I'm in love! :D <3"
1812,Super sexy!
1813,I love the bathing suit! It is very nicely made!! Fits perfect as well!
1814,"amazing, it fits me perfect! the quality is perfect as well"
1815,So custom that I looked skinny! Not just anyone can do that! Love the color and the fabric!
1816,Cute!
1817,Love this suit and thanks for always getting it to me when I need it!
1818,"Although there was a mix up with my order, I'm completely happy with the finished product."
1819,"Awesome suit, arrived by agreed upon date! Chest was a little large but I am only a B cup so maybe that just happens... love the suit though otherwise! :)"
1820,I got my swimsuit early but only because i had to open a case with esty on another high wasted swimsuit (i ordered a size 8 medium and got more of a size 12 i have to take it to get altered ) when i opened the case. She got back to me on the quickness..... i got my blue ruffle swimsuit and it was good the stiching on both swimsuits. Could have been better just not really what i was expecting but over all the swimsuits are cute
1821,love....my favorite swimsuit. would purchase again.
1822,Awesome product! Came really quickly too
1823,Very prompt with messaging and assured me that I would receive my order prior to leaving town. Would definitely order from here again :)
1824,"There was a miscommunication about the order, however she messaged me right away and my bathing suit was shipped. Looking forward to receiving it"
1825,This suit is absolutely perfect.
1826,Super Cute! The suit looks great I got the black low back Brazilian cut. It was exactly the simple one piece suit I was looking for! Anthony was really great to work with and he took my measurements so the suit would be a great fit I’m about 5’4” and about 130 lbs and ordered a Medium.
1827,"I am so impressed with this swimsuit! The owner got my measurements and it was a perfect fit! I have never had a swimsuit look this good on me before, and the feel and style of it is amazing! Beautiful in the back, and it makes my legs and butt look their best! It is so well made and came in a cute wrapped box. Excellent service from this shop, and decent shipping time too! I am so happy and pleased!"
1828,A very well made and beautiful looking swimsuit. My second buy here in this shop and I didn't get disappointed :) Thank you
1829,"Such a simple yet amazing bathing suit. Super sexy, but not too revealing. The shop owner is amazing. He really makes sure to get all your size details to make sure it’s the right fit. I received my item fairly quickly as well! Very happy!!!"
1830,Love it. I got the teal color and is gorgeous better in person than in picture. The fitting is just perfect.
1831,Best swimsuit ever! I love it!
1832,"Beautiful suit, great fit and excellent customer service! Will definitely purchase again."
1833,"Fast shipping, great service, cute suit! Love it!!"
1834,You did such an amazing job on my bikini!! It exceeded my expectations!!! I love it!!!
1835,"This review box is too short to explain how strongly I feel about this store. 
The service is amazing, Lori will go above and beyond to make sure her customers are happy and the product is perfect. As for the profuct, the print is beautiful, the quality is high, and the fit is perfect, mainly because Lori has no problem altering it to fit you if you're between sizes like I was.
I'm VERY happy about this purchase and the experience, 10/10 - will recommend. You will not regret buying from here!!! :)"
1836,It's a great product that's well made and fits great even for larger girls.  Would definitely order from this shop again (and probably will)!
1837,"Super cute, good quality."
1838,An awesome vendor to deal with!!! I needed some adjustments made and she took care of it AND shipped within 3 days of the order!!!
1839,"It fits perfectly. Goes just over the bottom of my rib cage. I haven’t worn it in the water yet, but I can’t wait to!"
1840,"Good quality item, comfy to wear and looks fab! I just have to waite fore the Norwegian summer....."
1841,"Shipping was pretty fast and i love my tops i bought, theyre perfect! thank you so much!"
1842,I'm not positive how I am going to keep this suit from falling but at least it will be cute while I can keep it on!
1843,Quick shipping and comfortable top !
1844,This bathing suit top was cute...but the material is terrible. There is no support or padding. It feels like I'm not wearing anything at all and it's honestly very uncomfortable. Now I have to spend more money to either get another bandeau or get some padding to put into this one.
1845,"Fast delivery! These bottoms fit better than any suit I've ever purchased and they match just about every swim top that I own. My hips around my butt measure 41 inches and waist 31 inches, I got a size Large and can't wait to take pics!"
1846,"I absolutely love this thing bikini bottom! It fits just like the white one in the photo on the model. The straps fit snug on your hips and create even more of a booty pop.
Also I recieved this item very quickly :-)"
1847,My man thinks I look hot af in these. 🥰
1848,"SO amazing! Size 8 and ordered an XL, fit perfectly."
1849,Fit perfectly and stayed up on my hips !
1850,I talk so comfy so I definitely like it. I recommend it. The pink it totally cute. I’m happy about my purchase
1851,"I was going on vacation a week after purchasing 2 of the thong bikinis and was worried it wouldn't come in time. Because she was located near by I was able to pick it up before my trip! I totally forgot I paid for shipping but she refunded the money without me even having to ask!! The product was great! Exactly what I was expecting and a great fit!! It truly is true to size!!

Great customer service!
Great purchase!

Will be ordering again!"
1852,Well made suit and she loves the way it adds to her (small) curves.  Thank you!
1853,"It fit perfect and although I was hesitant to buy this for the style, its very flattering!!  Great material and shipped fast!"
1854,Shipping was very fast! I bought the white bikini bottom. The material is great quality and fit me perfect! And it was lined enough where it’s not see through. I will definitely be buying more in different colors.
1855,"nice and thick fabric ladies. i was hesitant, but I'm pairing it with some lace skirts, and coverups from fashion nova. looks AMAZING."

1914,Seller showed good customer service when item I purchased fell apart.
1915,Great quality as everything else has been.
1916,Great quality as everything else has been.
1917,AWESOME ITEM VERY HAPPY THANK YOU
1918,"Did not fit. I am a small in EVERYTHING and this was way to large. I messaged seller to trade or have a solution in mind and she offered to alter them to a smaller size. When i told her they need to be made to an XS , she said she could not alter them. $35 for a thong that my local exotic store carries for $10. I am furious. I am a dancer and this was a total waste of money as I cannot wear a thong that is too large for obvious reason. I would have left 5 stars if she followed through with her offer to alter them!!!"
1919,see the other review on this item.
1920,Good thong but too small for me .
1921,Will not be ordering any product from this shop again.
1922,Waited weeks but the item never shipped. Tried to reach out to the owner multiple times but got no response. Had to open a claim. On the last day before etsy would have to get involved the owner offered a refund. I got my money back but what terrible service!
1923,Ordered November 9th and haven’t received item or an estimated shipping date. Finally got a response from seller Saturday saying desired color was back ordered but it did not say that when i ordered and it took me to reach out to even get that info. Now awaiting a response on if other color options are available but it’s been two days since I asked the question and no response . So sellers communication experience with my transactions unfortunately doesn’t align with other reviews saying they’ve had good communication with them .
1924,Never received product so can not give advise
1925,"I unfortunately can not comment on the bathing suits because I never received them. Order was shipped much later then when they marked it as shipped. Never received tracking and when I inquired about the whereabouts of my order I received a tracking number a couple of days later. The item was shown that it was delivered (the week before) but I did not get it. Because it was so long ago, there was not much I could do. Seller refused to assist in the process of filing a claim with USPS and I can not file one without them. I am very unhappy with this transaction and the fact that I am out over $100 with no attempted resolution on the sellers behalf. I have since order bathing suits elsewhere."
1926,"Beautiful suit! I love the design and fit. Perfect for my first trip to Cape Cod. I mix and match bikinis, but I’m wearing the top in this picture!"
1927,"Everything I was looking for..vintage, 50s, pin up, Cape Cod, nautical, cute. It’s comfortable and it fits wonderfully! Would highly recommend!"
1928,The suit is super cute and the bottom fit perfectly and didn’t create the dreaded muffin top! The XL top fit perfectly for larger breasts but is challenging since there is no support and I couldn’t seem to get the tie to tie tight enough to feel secure. Perhaps adding elastic to the inside of the tie straps? Also the addition of the tie around the neck helped but would love if it was a several inches longer so I could knot it twice. Overall so good and adorable!
1929,"Working with the shop owner, Kerry, is such a pleasure. She's so sweet and works with you to get your perfect fit. I love this suit so much! It's classy but old school sexy and I feel so confident on the beach!"
1930,"Super cute and arrived promptly! This ran a little small, but this particular fabric seems less stretchy than average swim fabric so perhaps that's why. Didn't have time to try for an exchange before my vacation so I just rolled with it."
1931,"Edit: Still love the looks of the suit but after wearing it to the beach, I experienced some issues that makes me rethink ordering a second suit. 

1. The bow is not tacked to the suit so when I went in the water it just flapped around. I eventually pulled the bow out of the loop that holds it so I could move around freely. 

2. The leg openings tend to flip and roll up, particularly towards the inside of the thighs. I was constantly having to adjust and unroll. 

It’s still a nice suit, but not great for water use. I did get a lot of compliments and the fabric is soft and comfortable. 

——————————————

The shop owner is an absolute pleasure to work with! The bikini arrived very quickly and it is lovely! Really well made and fit perfectly. I will definitely order another swimsuit soon!"
1932,"i have been desperately searching for a bikini that i feel comfortable and confident wearing. This Bikini ticks both boxes! my mummy tummy is given support but i can still show my girls that curves and a pot belly are not to be hidden away, it is normal to have shape and be healthy and look glamorous too!"
1933,"Loved the bathing suit so much ! My boobs are just way to big for the top ! I would get another suit for a vacation for just me and my boyfriend and not with his family lol ! Also spoke with the owner she was so sweet about returning my items !!!! 

Thanks you !"
1934,LOVE LOVE LOVE! SHIPPED ON TIME FOR MY HONEYMOON!
1935,This suit is so adorable and true to size. Fits perfectly! Thank you!! ❤️
1936,Adorable!!! I feel so confident in it.  Fit is great.
1937,Love this bikini. Kerry was a great vendor. When I wanted to exchange the bottoms for a different size she was happy to swap them for me. Really friendly and professional. Thank you!
1938,Didn't fit. And took a while to come in.
1939,Absolutely love my new swim suit !!
1940,Super fun suit!
1941,"Lovely set with a good value for money. Just as a sizing note: he bottom was a tiny bit too high for me as I have a fairly short back, but this is a very minor thing.  The only real minus for me was that normal tying of the top already caused some of the seaming to rip a bit, so maybe a little more attention should be paid to the maximal flexibility of the seams (especially important since the fabric is very strechy)."
1942,"I like it the top is a little small for
Double d breasts!"
1943,"Beautiful swimsuit, good quality, can't wait to wear it to the beach!"
1944,Came very quick. Nice fit!
1945,"It looks really nice, thank you"
1946,Fantastic fit & cannot wait to wear it on the beach - hopefully not too long to wait now :)
1947,"Very well made, and fast shipping!"
1948,Love! It'll be perfect. Going to old navy to get some cheap matching bottoms. I can't wait for the summer so I can use it ASAP. Definitely recommend and is true to bra size
1949,"Jennifer is amazing, so unbelievably helpful :)
She answered all my questions to perfection,
And knows swimwear....she knows that having a large bust can be a challenge purchasing swimwear, she took the time to answer all my questions,
My top is well made designer quality, I will absolutely purchase from her again 
Thank you for making my summer sparkle"
1950,Oh my!!!!! I love my new bikini top.  The size fitting is exactly as posted.  I am a 40DD and ordered the XL.  This is probably the best fit bikini top that I own.  They were able to send it to me before July 4th.  The colors look great.
1951,I love this top!! Super cute & made out of great quality material! Thank you!
1952,Swimsuit fit much larger than expected and the bow requested on the bottoms wasn't added.
1953,Great customer service with super fast responses to questions and exchanges. I ordered a size I thought would fit but when I tried it on it was too big. I was in a time crunch but she made sure I got the smaller size on time :-) I like my tops small. I am a 32D and size small fit the way I like.
1954,"SUPER CUTE! well made, perfect sizing. thicker straps make it comfy on the neck for larger bust. a must have!"
1955,"Shipped super fast, great quality, and fits perfectly! And the sizing goes up to DDD/F which is next to impossible to find in a cute style!"
1956,"Super cute, requested it with lining. Bottoms are cute too. Love that the pieces are customizable. Can't wait to wear for 4th of July!!"
1957,She loved it!
1958,Brilliant Product. Great Fit. Fab material. Love it
1959,very well made and fits perfectly. materials are perfect!
1960,Absolutely love it! Fast shipping and great customer service! Will be purchasing more.
1961,Awesome product ! Looks amazing on and so far has held up after several wears and machine washes.
1962,"Good material , supportive  and super cute"
1963,Very pleased with my purchase and the quality of the item.
1964,It wasn’t the size I ordered.
1965,WOW so beautiful! ❤️ I am SO impressed with the quality of these bikinis. I absolutely love how unique they are and different from what you would find in a store. I cannot thank you enough!
1966,Such a great person to do business with! Fantastic customer service and really does care about her products and customers! Great work and top quality product! Cant say enough about how much I love this suit!!
1967,Amazing bikini and super friendly seller :) thank you so much
1968,Very happy with item thank you!
1969,Regina did an amazing job on my suit! I have been waiting for it all week and as soon as I got it I tried it on and it fits perfectly! The craftsmanship is unbelievable and I will be ordering more items from her in the future. She even took the time to write a note wishing me a good vacation. We need more Reginas in the world!
1970,"Ridiculously beautiful! Seller was incredibly helpful and patient when it came to recommending the appropriate size for me (I typically wear a size 6/8 in bottoms and was looking for something 'cheeky' but by no means Brazilian and was recommended a size small). 'Safari' is a beautiful golden-beige, the small fit perfectly (long side-ties mean plenty of room for custom adjustments which is perfect), and the crochet work is undoubtedly professional - insanely beautiful and well worth the money and then some!"
1971,"The shop owner was very kind/friendly, and responded within the hour when i messaged her. my items arrived in a timely matter and everything exuded my expectations. i am very happy with my order."
1972,these are super cute but they took a long time to come in and they are VERY cheeky from the picture I thought they would cover more of the back.
1973,"The owner of this shop was so sweet! I asked her if there was any way she could have these bottoms ready by Spring Break, and she handmade them and shipped them right over ASAP. Great bottoms, very durable. Will definitely buy from here again!"
1974,"These are very well made bikini bottoms.  Considering they are made to order, they arrived in a good amount of time.  The attention to detail is superb, and the sweet, handwritten note in the package was a nice touch."
1975,This is my second pair of bottoms and they are just as perfect as the first pair. Just beautiful.
1976,Absolutely beautiful.  Will buy again!
1977,Beautiful color & craftsmanship ! Love it
1978,Can't wait to take these swimming.
1979,Love this suit! Very well handcrafted! Quick shipping to!
1980,"Regina shipped my order on time and she was very helpful when I had problem with the tracking. I like how the bikini fits, the bottoms are more cheeky than it looks in the photo, but I think the material is too thick and hard. And the strings are way too long for it's size."
1981,"The seller's communication was better than any company I've ever purchased from. I contacted her over 40 times during the process of creating my swimsuit and every time she aimed to pleased! The swimsuit itself is beautiful but I and the seller had to modify it a lot! The seller changed the style of the swimsuit for me(the neckline, the plunge back, and the fringe) I'm size 14 to 16 therefore the fringe that the model wore didn't work for triple d breasts. Once I received the swimsuit I still had to get some alterations done like cutting some fringe off because it was too bulky and getting the swimsuit taken in on both sides. The actual spandex  material of the body of the swimsuit was on the lower quality and didn't really snatch the body. My profile is the swimsuit. I want something else made but i want it in person!!!"
1982,Just received it yesterday tried it on fits perfect....I gave them my size told them how I wanted it ..and that's the way they made it BEAUTIFUL well made....I love how the owner had patience and communicate with you...and their quick response. . Thx again will send pics when I wear it...
1983,"I just love my bathing suit,,,great fit and the seller was willing to make adjustments to the suit for me,,I will be back,,thank you"
1984,"I loved this piece but it was small on me and seller tried everything to accommodate by even getting my sizes and my body would not cooperate. Even though i returned it, the seller was great and did her best."
1985,"LOVE everything about it! The seller is so nice and even included a blue gem incase I wanted to change it for the opal gem. Plus, it was really fast shipping. Received it after 3 days. Thank you! Will be ordering more in the future! :)"
1986,I love it soo much! It hides my fat belly! It worths my 62.00! I'll totally wear this at a pool party or at the pool! Really comfortable too! I love it! I'd buy from her/him!
1987,"Love my bathing suit, great quality! I can't wait to wear it on my upcoming Disney trip. The shop owner was great about exchanging bottom sizes for me in a timely and fair manner. In my experience her items run true to size. I sized up on the bottoms because of my top size which was not necessary. I would recommend ordering true to size even if that means mixing sizes on top/bottom."
1988,Love the suit!
1989,"I (Jim's wife) will feel so special and elegant in this swimsuit, as I will also match my 6 year old granddaughter in her Jasmine swimsuit. Totally fun!!"
1990,Wonderfully made pieces and awesome communication. Ty so much!
1991,"Wow, this is my third cover up from ZoeZstudio and I love it just like the others. It's chic and elegant looking. I usually wear a size large and this fits perfectly.  Zoe's cover ups seriously give pieces from high end brands a run for their money."
1992,I have now purchased 3 Swim cover ups. I constantly receive positive comments Or inquiries of where I purchased when I wear. Very reasonable and great quality. Thank you as always!
1993,"Love it!!! Arrived quickly, would purchase again from this shop."
1994,Very cute- thanks so much!
1995,"True to picture, pretty design, good quality."
1996,"This bikini is beautiful.  It fits perfectly and very well made.  It did take over a month to receive, but well worth it!  Thanks."
1997,Lovely Handmade Bikini!! It feels very unique and it suits so well. I have received it very quickly after ordering it.
1998,"Wonderful, thank you,  everything better than expected!"
1999,Shipped fast! I got a red one- piece swimsuit. Probably would have liked a black one better. True to size! I ordered a size small and I’m 5’5” 135lbs
2000,I ordered this bathing suit for my birthday. I looooove it!
2001,"Love, love, love! Swimsuit is a really good quality and color is perfect."

2006,"Fast, good quality and good communicators. 10/10 recommend!"
2007,Looks amazing on my bride squad team!
2008,great gift! letters look just as pictured and good quality suit!
2009,"Although, the team was great with customizing my drip squad birthday swimsuits, the colors were completely off and the designs were peeling off upon receipt. They did offer a 15% off discount for my inconvenience, however I will not recommend using them again as I was not satisfied with my purchase. Especially, with purchasing a bulk."
2010,"Responsive service, item received as expected."
2011,"I am absolutely in love with my new purchase! Breezie Stardust was so accommodating to my custom order, and very prompt with responding to my messages. She knew exactly what I was envisioning with a custom cut I requested, and I love my bathing suit! Shipping was prompt, and I received my package nicely wrapped and in perfect condition."
2012,The suit is fantastic and very unique; I really love it! Breezie had amazingly fast communication and was very attentive and helpful with sizing. So satisfied!!
2013,"Best suit ever! Wonderful quality and she was able to tailor it according to me needs. Great material, great cut! My new favorite suit!! Will be recommending to all my friends! So happy I found her shop!!"
2014,"I messaged them informing them I needed the suit in 10 days and I received it the next day! great suit, great quality! I am curvy and it's still super flattering :)"
2015,Shipping is fast! Received this swimsuit within three days! Fits perfectly and have been wearing it everywhere and gotten too many complements! I will be ordering more suits ASAP! So happy that this suit is so unique and fits like you wish every pac sun or aerie suit did.
2016,This suit is an absolute dream!! Well made. I feel secure in it and it is quite the eye catcher. Breezie was incredible to work with. Helped me by making my suits by the date I needed. Communicative. All around a great experience. Can't wait to purchase more designs!
2017,I love it!! Fits perfectly!
2018,I Love it! Fits amazing
2019,Awesome swimsuit. Great Fit. The fabric is great and looks really cool. Thanks Breezy.

2025,"Omg??!!! I LOVE my new suit!!! It's more than what I expected!!! It's beautiful and well fitted on... I've tried on suits from Macy's, TJMAXX, all the swimsuit stores, Victoria Secrets and this suit BY FAR, beats all the one piece suits on the market!!! And the seller is the sweetest person I've dealt with and had the pleasure of meeting on Etsy!!! THANK YOU IRIT!!! Soooooo happy"
2026,"I love my new swimsuit!! It fits so well and is such a classy, sexy, sophisticated design!! Thank you :)"
2027,Beautiful swim suit. Great owner. Really responsive
2028,The swimsuit is very well made. A great fit for me. I am really happy with the purchase!  Thanks Again !!!
2029,I love it SO MUCH!
2030,I have to say there are quite some space for the sewing work to be improved for a $120 swimsuit. The good thing is I like this style a lot.
2031,The stitching does not allow for stretching much as you're putting the swimsuit on and the the lower backside is a bit revealing. Finally I would be happier if the front ended with a bit more tasteful décolletage. I'm just not sure I'll wear it as it is lacking a bit in modesty. I may try taking it to a seamstress.
2032,"Exactly as pictured. I wear  00 at Loft I got an XS , it was a little big but washing and drying took care of it. Thank you."
2033,So cute and comfy! Thank you we love them🤗

2044,Item turned out perfect and the customer service CAN'T be beat!! Would absolutely purchase from this seller again!!
2045,"Arrived just as expected, ordered a medium and probably could have been ok with a small. Normal size 6."
2046,"Oh my gosh! I just got my new monokini in the mail and I am in LOVE. It is the first swimsuit that I have had that fits me perfectly, because of the custom sizing. I have some stretch marks on my tummy, so I usually wear fuller monokinis, but this design is PERFECT. I especially love the butt! The top strap is actualy doubled, so it provides plenty of support for my top heavy frame. Shipping took a little bit longer than I had expected. This is my first Etsy purchase, so that may be typical. The seller is very quick to respond to messages and very polite. Thank you so much lovelucybea! It is such a beautiful suit!!"
2047,"love my ""rhythm"" swimsuit thank you for your hard work! I did wait a little longer for my order but I didnt really need it ASAP so i was ok with the wait plus i rather lucy not rush and do a perfect job ;) I will be ordering more from her. One thing the bottom is very small so i will be sure to order the bottom a little bigger and the ruffles part of the swimsuit is not tight againts my body but im ok with that..maybe i have a shorter torso ..lol..idk? but either way I LOVE IT! thank again lucy keep up the good work doll!"
2048,Wow! This bathing suit is amazing! Its Gorgeous! I will br back! Thanks for meeting my time frame....super fast shipping!! Wonderful
2049,"This transaction was nothing short of amazing. I contacted Lucy with a very short deadline of 2 weeks and asked if I could receive the suit by then, and I placed my order on April 14th and relieved it in the mail on April 17th. 3 days! I'm very pleased with the quality of the suit and with the sellers customer service. Thanks for the unique piece!"
2050,Lucy is awesome! I have purchased several suits from her and ALWAYS get tons of compliments!
2051,"I was on a short timeframe with vacation right around the corner, she worked with me and got it out to me before I left for vacation.  This monokini is very comfortable, double straps around the neck so there is no discomfort!"
2052,LOVE this suit so much! Tons of compliments. Beautiful shade of red. Thanks!

2060,Fit issues were resolved graciously by seller.
2061,"Perfect like always
Tnx iffi 💚"
2062,"Awesome shipping time, especially for international. Loved the handmade designs and love put into the piece. The fabric does sort of roll up around the edges, giving it an unfinished look. Cute. My tag was mislabeled, so I thought I was sent leggings until I opened the package, but it happens!"
2063,beautiful and skillfully made! My favorite bathing suit to date. can’t wait to get another one! These are so comfortable and fit perfect! Thank you
2064,This is the softest bikini I have ever worn. It fits perfectly. The colors Are vibrant. It’s so comfortable. Beautifully made. And the packaging was SO cute.  Thank you so much!
2065,"Love it!!!
Every vacation I buy myself one of Iffi swimwear
They fit me perfectly
They unic and beautiful"
2066,"designs and fabric are absolutely amazing and they fit beautifully! colours can differ a bit from displayed but it’s due to the dying technique. Iffi was extremely patient, kind and professional! i love my bikinis and will definitely restock for next summer!!"
2067,"The bikini it's awesome,really well made, and plus the package is really nice"
2068,Ordered the same swimsuit in a different color last summer. Already want another one! So cute and unique❤️❤️❤️

2072,"very nice bikini, thank u!"
2073,LOVE this red bow bandeau top! Needed it for a photo shoot and looked absolutely amazing! Very comfortable and really looks like a bow.
2074,"I loved my red bow bikini top! I received SO many compliments on it, and it fit perfectly! Thank you so much! I am looking forward to ordering more swimsuits! :)"
2075,"Thank you! I recommend adding your own padding to help support you, other then that, it's beautiful"
2076,Adorable thanks I love it
2077,"When i saw the picture of this item I wanted it right away. The amount of time it took to ship was average, however the chart that was required to follow was a bit ""off."" My bandeau is a bit too small, but thankfully the bow part covers it. Overall, its not an AMAZING item, but I still think it's cute. I have yet to swim with it though."
2078,"No response when I asked a question, and the bathing suit was smaller than I needed and I went by the sizing chart."
2079,"I LOVE my new bikini! I have always wanted one in white but was concerned it would be see through. I contacted Drea and she immediately let me know she could double line the front bottoms.Her service is professional, kind, fast and efficient! I will be ordering from her again very soon😍"
2080,I wore these to Bali. Let's just say that they accentuated and emphasized my assets and turned a few heads. Well-made and super cute!
2081,I wore these to Bali. Let's just say that they accentuated and emphasized my assets and turned a few heads. Well-made and super cute!
2082,"Quick shipping! Great quality, however it runs smaller than most swimwear, I would order up a size!:)"
2083,perfect & true to size
2084,Shipping was on time and I love the final product!
2085,"It's super cute, but for the price I expected the quality to be better."
2086,Looks great with the bikini bottoms I purchased along with it. The extra detail on the straps makes it even more flirty. Can't wait to wear!
2087,Good transaction and product. Very good
2088,"Its horrible. I'm an A cup and got a small and its still too tiny. It has no padding so you're constantly nipping, poor quality too."
2089,"Awesome bandeau :) fits my bikini bottoms I lost the top from and also awesome to cosplay the little mermaid! :) I was searching for something I could wear in every day life, but also use for Ariel. It was faster here than predicted and fits very well, even though it’s strapless."
2090,It looks great. It shipped on time. I wasnt sure of the size since I am a guy. But it was easily changed to make a little smaller. My Halloween costume as Ariel worked great with this addition
2091,"Suits me really well, the colour is beautiful. I got exactly what I was expecting!"
2092,Thank you so much. It’s very cute .
2093,"Fits almost perfectly, definitely needed a slightly bigger size but that's a fault on my part haha. Other than that, the product is beautifully made."
2094,Top came in time with the rush shipping. Good quality and fit well on my friend. Great for comic con.
2095,It's lovely.  Not too thin. Shipped quickly

2103,Everything on this page is just amazing!
2104,I love it! It fits great & the quality is excellent! Was totally worth the wait :)
2105,"I ordered this crochet bikini top in cream for my upcoming vacation to St. Martin.  I received my order in plenty of time and could not be happier with the top.  Absolutely gorgeous and fits perfectly.  Very good quality.  I added the lining, which I recommend doing.  Maryana also included a little gift---love it, thank you!  I will definitely order again."
2106,I love the top.  It fits perfectly!  Thank you.
2107,Wonderful experience with this seller.  The Tops fit so well.  Thank you for your hard work.
2108,"I ordered the cover up for a spur of the moment trip to Puerto Rico, and the owner was super helpful and shipped it to me so I would have it in time for my trip. The cover up was perfect and I absolutely love it!"
2109,I am VERY pleased with the swimsuit cover up I ordered from this shop!!! Beautifully made and it will definitely turn heads when at the beach! I ordered the neon/coral/orange cover...it is very bright...but perfect for the summer!The seller did an amazing job getting this item to me in the exact time frame I needed it! Thanks so much!
2110,It was perfect! I got so many compliments when I was wearing it around. Thank you!
2111,Love love love it!!!  The coverup is even more beautiful in person!
2112,Beautiful and very well made!! She was very accommodating and even mailed my cover up to where I was vacationing.
2113,"Great cover-up! The neon yellow is WOW- electric :). Due to the type of material, washed well, but easy to wrinkle. Still overall, I am very pleased with purchase. Nothing some Downy wrinkle release can't handle. SO UNIIQUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just have to love something that was made especially for you. Definitely recommend. Many thanks!"
2114,"This cover-up is gorgeous!!! The color is ""perfection"" and so is the work... I absolutely LOVE IT----am ordering another one!!!! Thanks"
2115,"My wife loved this surprise for our vacation! And to top it off, the seller was super nice, attentive, and helped me tremendously. Would recommend her in a heartbeat"
2116,The service was fantastic. The cover-up is the best material I've seen!
2117,Very good quality! Cannot wait to wear it on vacation. The seller was easy to work with. Thank you so much!
2118,"Very nice, can't wait to wear it !"
2119,"Had to wait add’l time due to the quarantine, but well worth the wait. Lovely quality and super cute. Very impressed!!"
2120,I ordered XL and boy did I get that! Nice since so many bikini stores don’t honor chesty ladies.
2121,"took a while to figure out the sizing, but the custom made top fits perfectly!"
2122,tres tres bon produit agréablement surpris a la reception
2123,"I love it, & so did everyone else!!! Wore it Memorial Day wknd Vegas 2014. Perfect fit want more colors. Thumbs up 2 Etsy u rock!"
2124,"LOVE IT! Super Sexy and my man melted when I walked out! Not an everywhere type of suit, but for those sexy miami pool parties or the bedroom it is perfect!"
2125,It's PERFECT for my upcoming photoshoot!
2126,Schnelle Lieferung. Problemlos. Einfach hergestellt. Für Photoshooting sehr gut. Als Badeanzug wenig geeignet.
2127,"The material used to make the suit is not bathing suit material, very cheap looking. It's almost a grayish black not sheen or sexy at all. I could compare the material to the cheap waistbands or belts that come free with clothing. The fabric is very uncomfortable and unfortunately I won't  wear the product. Expected a lot better quality for the price. Will not order again. Hopefully in the future she changes the fabric she uses, since the style of the suit is beautiful. If she used a better quality fabric that didn't look so cheap, I'm sure I would have loved the suit."
2128,Honestly my favorite feature I've added to my competition suit.  Arrived fast and just as described; perfect :)
2129,Sehr schöne Verarbeitung und funkelt extrem. Artikel wurde sofort versandt und kam termingerecht an.
2130,Great one ! I am buying more connectors here
2131,"thanks a lot, it's nice."
2132,Love this! It's the cutest design and I love the back.
2133,"I ordered this adorable suit in a size large. I should have gotten a medium, but there were only larges left in stock and I just couldn't resist! It's just a tad too large in the waist, but the bust and hips seem to fit just fine. Aside from ordering the wrong size, this suite is pretty much perfect! The material is SO soft and comfy. I tried it on and kept it on for hours because it was just too comfortable to take off!"
2134,"Superbe maillot ! Mesures sur le site fit parfaitement! Tissus épais et de qualité 
Merci"
2135,"Love this one piece! High quality material, put together well. Can’t wait for summer so I can wear it."
2136,"Size ran a bit big, the end of the straps on the back would scallop outwards. Good material and fit otherwise."
2137,"I ordered this bikini while I was in Canada and noted my arrival in Hawaii. I received this bikini the moment I landed in Maui but unfortunately it wasn't reversible as I requested. However, I immediately messaged Annie on IG about it and she quickly made another one for me which I received two days after! Thank you, Annie for your promptness and efficiency. Order from this store, you won't be disappointed! The quality and the owner is great :)"
2138,"In South Florida you find yourself at the beach pretty much every week. This is my 16th piece from InikiSwimwear and third HONI string bikini bottom (my favorite out of all the styles).

For the price of two bikini bottoms in one (and custom-made just for you!) the price is very worth it.

Will be purchasing more in the future 🥰"
2139,"Love it! A size small fits perfectly on size 3 jeans, plus it's adjustable. If you're tired of those big, booty covering bikinis, this one is definitely a must. I also ordered another piece from her and can't wait for that one. Thanks for making these!"
2140,"Love this bottom, it fits a bit too low in the back, but other than that it’s wonderful quality and has a to die for look. This girl has just knocked it out of the Park with her bikini bottoms. First time I’ve gotten a bikini bottom and had them fit me perfectly!"
2141,"These bikini bottoms are very well made. They’re comfy, cute and stay in place. I’ll definitely be buying more in the future"
2142,I love it! It was perfect!
2143,Perfect fit. Very well made!
2144,"Great quality suit! Seller was good to work with, will be ordering from again!"
2145,These bottoms are so so sexy and not as revealing as I thought for a thong. Very tasteful and well made!
2146,"I've bought this same bikini bottom THREE times now (first I lost it, then I got it shipped to the wrong address...all my fault, lol). It was worth it every time! The quality is incredible - the lace isn't delicate at all, I didn't have to worry about it ripping. It fits perfect, and I messaged Ashley with my measurements so she made sure I got the size I needed. I will always go here for my bikinis, I've never been more satisfied with a bathing suit. Shipping was also extremely quick, I got my purchase in less than 5 days! Thank you so much!"
2147,"I bought this for my spring break trip to Mexico and had to stop counting the compliments I got. This bikini bottom was borderline magical. It sits snuggly on your hips like it's painted on and despite how little it is, it's still one of the most flattering pieces in my wardrobe. Seriously, this thing makes you feel like you're radiating sexiness. And it's not low quality fabric either. The stitching is durable, and even my boyfriend was impressed by the high quality of the fabric. I would recommend any of these bottoms over Victoria's Secret ones any day.

Even the service was great. Ashley was an awesome communicator and worked to send my order in time for my March 1 sale date. I would definitely recommend this shop, and definitely buy from Ashley again!"
2148,Well put together bikini bottom. It fits great. I’m a size US10 pants and I got a large. It fits perfectly.
2149,"125 lbs 5'4"" small bottom worked FABULOUS. Got the red lace top in medium. Seller was so quick to respond to any issues/concerns, and fast tracked the shipping to make sure I got in time for my tropical vacation. EXCELLENT, sexy, well made product, and even better CUSTOMER SERVICE. Definitely a repeat customer."
2150,I bought this for my wife for our vacation to Mexico. She looked incredibly sexy in it and it fit her perfectly!
2151,I received my bottoms just in time to take them to Vegas for the weekend.  I loved them and definitely plan on ordering more suits in the future!
2152,Both were super cute.  If I had any advice it would be to use a stronger lace.  Love the fit.
2153,Oh my gosh! I live in Miami so I am always trying to find a super cute bikini- these bottoms are amazing!
2154,My 4th thong from her.  Super cute fit!
2155,Fits perfectly! Highly recommended! It's exactly what wanted. Thanks!
2156,I love love love the Ellie bikini bottoms!  Thank you so much!  and thank you for making them for me when you were out of stock!  🙏🏻
2157,I absolutely love my bikini bottoms! I can choose any color and customize. What's better than that? Very fast delivery and shipping! I will be ordering again. Thank you!
2158,Super sexy and flattering. Glad I bought this!
2159,my questions were answered quickly and item shipped on time. Fits great!
2160,My 3rd thong.  The fit is cute.
2161,"The bathing suit was so cute and perfect! Only thing - the front is part lace. It’s still cute, but I didn’t know that and it wasn’t advertised so it took my by surprise"
2162,I LOVE THIS PRODCUT AND THE SHIP WAS VERY FAST
2163,It's fits perfectly and looks great.
2164,"Amazing! Great quality- fits perfectly!
Will re order more!"
2165,Perfect fit- the bottoms can go with any top
2166,Ordered two bottoms.  I am a size small but sized up to a M.  They fit nicely.  The lace could be sturdier.
2167,They make my a$$ look great! I just ordered two more in different colors! Great quality. True to size. Can't wait to wear them in Mexico!
2168,Great suit. Quality material. Super cute on.  Sizing was off on most of mine was only complaint. Never two the same. Yellow lace one is a yellow lace not white also.
2169,I didn't know it would be a shiny material. Love the back but the front looks tacky.
2170,Cute style but cheaply made with cheap material.
2171,My guy loves it .thank u very pleased.
2172,Loves these and they got great! Fast shipping and communication.
2173,"So, this looks like underwear. The lace in the front makes it look like lingerie. Fits nice & is sexy but not a fan of the lace on a bathing suit."
2174,I love my suits and can’t wait to wear them!
2175,"Fast shipping, great customer service, will be getting my bathing suits from here for now on!"
2176,Amazing product great material well made and comfortable !!
2177,Wonderful service and amazing product will order again!
2178,"Fast shipping, thanks, great quality 😊"
2179,The lace on the bottoms was double lined so it was not in fact sheet as displayed. I ended up having my seamstress take them apart and fix them. 😏
2180,Good quality and flattering. I bought the black string thong bikini bottom from her as well and its also very nice.
2181,Shipped right on time. Nice design.
2182,"I ordered an XS bikini, and XS was clearly marked on the bag.  However the bikini shipped inside the plastic bag was and XL."
2183,Item is great.   Material appears to be more like underwear then bathing suit but looks great on.
2184,Thank you for resolving the issue with my package. Much Appreciated.
2185,"I ordered this at the end of aug and it was supposed to arrive early sept. The item never arrived. I reached out to the seller who said production was behind but should be shipped in another week. I also asked for help with sizing and the seller requested me to send her pictures of me. I was hesitant but sent them due to her good reviews. After that, she stopped responding to my messages and I never heard from her and never received the item. I had to open a case with Etsy and requested a refund. It wasn’t until a few days after that the seller responded and apologized and offered 20% off. However, I do not trust her now to order again. This was my first negative experience with Etsy. Its really disappointing since I wanted the bathing suit for a weekend getaway with my new husband before he deploys."
2186,"I ordered the neon geometric bikini from Rose. I told her my measurements and took pictures of myself. I expressed to her my concern that my waist is very small but I have wide hips and a booty. Rose assured me a medium would fit (normally I’m a large bikini bottom) and she altered it a bit in the hip area so I didn’t get that “muffin top” affect. It fits PERFECTLY, the quality is very very good. The color is so vibrant even more so than in the picture. Stunning.

Now for the top- I ordered a medium as I am a 34 C, Rose suggested maybe I even order a large. I told her I normally wear a small top so I went with the medium, she ended up being right! I did need the larger top, I have a party this weekend and was terrified! Rose went above and beyond! I sent it back and she made me a large THAT DAY. I highly recommend Rose 🌹 ❤️"
2187,"Rose is truly the best. This top is of the utmost quality, and when I got mine and it didn't fit exactly how I had hoped, she worked (very patiently haha) with me as I explained to her via email how I wanted it. I got a custom top! I couldn't have better things to say about this experience. Super fast shipping too, especially considering it's coming from Hawaii."
2188,"As I live in Scotland I was quite unsure about ordering a bikini due to possible sizing issues so I decided to message Rose with my measurements! So kind and helpful, with fast replies I was able to select a top and bottom matching set. Rose updated me on how my order was going and when it was to be shipped - it arrived exactly 8 days later! I cannot fault the bikini! It's perfect in every way - the quality, style, fit and colours are all amazing! Can't thank Rose enough for all her help and hard work!

One very happy customer  :)"
2189,"This top is worth every penny! I am a petite DD so shopping for bikinis can be challenging, especially if I want to be able to move around confidently. I'm not 100% secured, but that's to be expected. The cross back straps are threaded through reinforced loops, so the back can be tightened as much as you need. Very pleased and will order again. Great customer service as well--all of my questions were answered promptly."
2190,I can't explain how much I love this bathing suit!!!! It is very good quality not thin at all and fits great!!! I'm a DDD and the Lg fits great!!!! Thank you again!!! You just made my Honeymoon that much better!!
2191,"I GIVE THIS SELLER 10 STARS!!! Exceeded my expectations! Rose has wonderful customer service,she friendly and kind! She went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with my items! I already had high expectations from just looking at the pictures of her swim suits, but I was very surprised to see how well made my bikini is. It's very high quality and nice material! It fits perfectly! Thank you so much Rose!"
2192,"Amazing color and very fast shipping! This top can be tightened as much as you need and its perfect. It just doesn't have padding but hey, wear Band-Aid's and you'll be fine."
2193,"Thanks for the extremely fast service. The package came today in the mail!
It is absolutely wonderful and perfect in every way. Thank you so much for your help in deciding what sizes to get. We will be ordering more from you in the future!!! 
-Lois"
2194,My daughter is very gifted in the Breast area. She wears 36C and the top looks great on her. Better then the model. Suzanne
2195,"The item arrived MUCH faster than I anticipated, far in advance of my trip as promised! And the swimsuit is gorgeous! The colors are even more vibrant in person! I will definitely shop here again."
2196,"The cross-back looks great! Rose assisted me when picking out just the right fit & size for my Fiance. Shipping was lightning fast, and upon arrival, it fit her perfect (as all of Rose's handy-work does!)"
2197,I loved this when I saw it online and absolutely LOVED it when I saw it in person! It is made very well and was shipped fast. It's super comfy and I pretty much don't want to take it off! Thank you!
2198,I absolutely love my swimsuit top!! The colors and way it fits me are amazing!!❤️❤️
2199,Fits perfect! And GraffitiBikini is a great company. Def recommend her.
2200,Loving my bikini! The material is SUPER comfy and I can't wait to train with it at swim practice and show it off on the beach!
2201,Top notch material perfect fit.
2202,Fits perfectly and makes my body look great!
2203,This swim suit is so bright and eye catching! I love the back and it is such a great fit!
2204,"Awesome top, great fit. Really shows off my upper body muscles which I appreciate since I work my ass off for this back and these shoulders."
2205,I love this bikini! Perfect fit and great quality.
2206,"I've already put in a second order, I love these tops so much!! The best cross back bikini top I've owned, hands down."
2207,"Love this cross-back style, and the amount of coverage is just right."
2208,"This bikini is AWESOME!  It fits great (which I was worried about because usually I always end up having a saggy butt, too small, etc).  The craftsmanship is excellent, and the colors are way more vibrant than expected.  It's perfect!  I will definitely be ordering more. :)"
2209,Fits perfectly. Quality is great!
2210,IN LOVE TWITH THE COLORS AND PATTERN. VERY GOOD QUALITY AND LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING MORE :)
2211,Very cheeky but super flattering - both bottom and top.
2212,"great fit.  I'm an A34, i bought a small.
would suggest others to buy from here too:)"
2213,Love my bikini. Can actually swim and be active. Cross back is the best n
2214,"Such a fun bikini top with bright, amazing colors! I can't wait to get tan and wear this in the sun!"
2215,great bikini fits really well
2216,"Fits great! XS was definitely the way to go. I'm 5'l, ~97 lbs, shorter torso. XS fits me just right"
2217,"First of all this swimsuit fits like a glove. I'm a chubby chica at 5'3 and 160 pounds and I got the Large... It fits perfect!!!! The cat suit is hilarious and super cute. I wore it on vacation in Puerto Vallarta and got a lot of compliments. 
Not to mention, I ordered it on a Monday and needed it by Friday before my flight to Mexico on Saturday morning...... And it was express shipped and arrived just in time!!!! 
Great communication, great customer service, and great product."
2218,"I just received the bathing suit and I love it!  It is exactly as shown on the site and fits perfectly!  I haven't worn it in the water yet but he quality seems great.  

There were a few issues with shipping, but the shop was very responsive to my inquiries and managed to sort it out reasonably.  Little logistical glitches happen all the time and I really think that the way a shop responds is the most important and I couldn't be happier with Badinka!"
2219,This is just the best!! Absolutely love it! And the cat turned out to be all spacy in blacklights so great extra effect!! Thanks
2220,"There are no words for how freaking awesome this swimsuit/bodysuit is! The unique cosmo-cat image is printed in gorgeous, vibrant colors that haven't faded or rubbed (even in white jeans) & on quality material that doesn't sheer out when stretched like cheap garments will. It is well made & durably constructed, so I know I can look forward to it being a fun wardrobe staple into the future! Chavdar communicates politely & promptly, and he addressed my sizing concerns by assuring me he would use a pattern suited for my measurements. I'm 5'10"", 159lbs & 36-29-39 so though a M would fit, I ordered a L for comfort and it fits perfectly! I get so many compliments. I will definitely be back for more items on my wishlist! I can't wait to see BadInkA expand as a brand, they have made a loyal customer out of me! Thank you!!! 😘👍💯😍❤️💋"
2221,Absolutely LOVE my suit! The fit was great! It looks awesome! Exactly what I expected.
2222,"I bought it for my daughter and she loves it. It's tight, fits perfectly, so if you want a little extra room buy larger. She loves the way it fits though."
2223,Amazing onepiece super comfy and so pretty !
2224,The colors are vibrant and it fits true to size. It arrived sooner than I expected. Will be fun to wear to a caturday party!

2227,Good quality and awesome style
2228,really nice love it !
2229,Great clothing! Wonderful workmanship and adorable items. Slow shipping.
2230,"I contacted the shop before I ordered to make sure I would get this in time for my honeymoon. I was assured that it would be there in the time allotted if I ordered by a certain date, so I placed the order. I never received this item. I tried contacting the shop owner as the days got closer the when I needed it, and he never got back to me. It wasn't until I contacted etsy after my honeymoon that the owner of the shop finally got back to me. He apologized and gave me another excuse, a refund, and told me to keep the package once delivered. I had to contact the post office because there was a problem with delivery. The problem was that there was never an apartment number on the package so they sent it back to the sender. Extremely disappointing all the way around."
2231,"These sarongs are so beautiful; Sue ships them at rocket speed, and I really appreciate that!
The quality and patterns are gorgeous -- now's the time to get 'em while the weather is warming up.
Thank you, Sue!"
2232,"The colors are exactly as pictured and really beautiful! Shipping is super-fast and well packaged!

2235,This is my second PuaWear sarong. I love them so much. I want them all. The vibrant prints and fabric quality are exceptional. The weight of the fabric has a lovey drape.  I feel sexy and stylish wearing these sarongs. Thank you for making these in plus sizes!!!
2236,"Love this!  The color and pattern is beautiful!  The size and quality are perfect!  I am very, very pleased!"
2237,I love this sarong.  It's a beautiful teal on black and it is lovely.  I have 3 sarongs from PuaWear and each one is absolutely beautiful.   Elizabeth

2250,Great quality fabric. Going to purchase two more soon . Thank you.
2251,love it! cant wait to wear it to the beach!
2252,Beautiful. Quick dispatch. Colour not so brigh as in the picture.
2253,"Super décue de cette commande! Déjà le prix pour un si petit bout de tissu est abusé, mais si encore les finitions et la qualité étaient là, je serais passé dessus.
Mais là, les franges sont plus courtes que sur la photo, elles sont rigides froissées et mal coupées, et elle s’effilochent au bout! 
Quand au délai de livraison n’en parlons pas... bref je n’aurais jamais du commander ce top noir! Et encore pire avec le blanc (que j’ai commandé également) dont le tissu et les franges ne sont meme pas du meme blanc! L’un est ivoire et l’autre très blanc..."
2254,Was super comfy and cute the perfect shirt to complete my look!
2255,Perfect in every way and I will definitely shop here again. The delivery time was fantastic and excellent customer service.
2256,Nice fabric and cloth the ware for a festival :) Love it
2257,It was here quickly and fits perfectly!
2258,High quality item. Didn't set me back a whole lot
2259,"Very cute, loved it"
2260,Exactly as pictured and very comfortable.
2261,Very good quality item!! I did receive the wrong item at first but the seller was wonderful communicating with me and fixing the problem and she sent me the right top right away! Very pleasant and will definitely be ordering again
2262,"It's alright, but defenitely overpriced."
2263,"LOOOVE this suit! It's super cute and the M fit perfectly. For reference, I'm normally a size 4 in dresses and a 26/27 in jeans. DO NOTE that since it's white you may be showing a little extra skin. I made the mistake of waiting till the last minute to order my suit, and the seller accommodated rush shipping for me, which was fab. If I need any other party suits, I will def be shopping here :)"
2264,Very cute. I love it.
2265,Very nice quality! Can't wait to wear this poolside during my bachelorette weekend.
2266,Item seems a bit smaller then I’d like. I’m normally an XL I ordered a 2XL and I think I would have preferred a 3xl just to be more comfortable
2267,i Never recieved my order
2268,The cut of the top was exactly what I wanted. I needed a larger size but I made it work.
2269,I have this in 2 colors and absolutely love them! I wore this one recently in Cabo and got so many compliments! Very flattering!
2270,"Love it! It fits great and holds me all in, yet still helps me feel a bit sexy. Perfect."
2271,This seller worked with me on a custom color - it's exactly what I wanted!  Great shop!
2272,Drea responded quickly to any questions I had and I absolutely love my bikini top! Unique and well made.
2273,"Great style, fun colour. Thx!"
2274,Im 38d/dd and got lg but was too small.  By the time I even tried it on was too late to even ask for exchange. It came fast and i love it other wise
2275,It’s worth it to invest in a custom bikini! This is the first time I feel like one truly flatters my body. And the seller honored my wish for reduced packaging while still packing it cute!
2276,Anthony went above and beyond with my request to create a beautiful set for me. I explained that I needed the items to arrive before a certain date and he had absolutely no problem making it happen. I live in the U.S. and my package arrived in 2 weeks!! It is well made to my measurements! Fits perfectly.  I was even able to choose a color not listed. Customer service is a 10/10. I am so grateful. Can't wait to order again!
2277,Fits perfectly and is great quality.  Arrived very fast!  The box it came in was very pretty too!  Will definitely purchase from him again!
2278,The package arrived earlier than expected and the box was nicely decorated! The bikini fits perfect and is as beautiful as on the pictures. I'll definitely order again here :)
2279,"5 stars for everything: the bikini and the seller, Anthony! The shipping to Italy took two months, probably due to Covid-19, but of course it was not seller’s fault. The quality of the bikini is great!"
2280,"Fits perfectly, comfortable, and sexy. I love it! Thank you."
2281,Beautifully crafted
2282,LOVE! Matches perfectly with 3 of my bikini bottoms :)
2283,"Exactly like the picture, fits great and it is extremely cute!"
2284,loved the item! shipped in time
2285,"Absolutely loooove these bottoms! Great quality and fit! Sad I didn't realize there was a set, just ordered the top separately."
2286,This is so adorable!  I am so impressed with how quickly I received it considering it came from Turkey.  I cannot wait to wear this in Mexico.  Love the lavender sachets she includes in the package.
2287,"It is perfect. I will buy at least two more for the summer. Shipping is very fast, the owner is lovely and very caring!"
2288,smaller than i thought it would be but worked out perfectly for my trip! was given lots of compliments on these but the one downside is when wearing for prolonged amount of time it does become stretched out which makes it uncomfortable but overall great experience and would most definitely order from seller again.
2289,Shipped on time! looks just like the picture! I think I'm going to get another one ^_^
2290,"I was so excited to get this bikini! It looks great on, its just a little big once it gets wet. Would recommend getting a size smaller."
2291,Love it! Does run a little big but I also have not remeasured myself since I lost weight. Very comfy top though! Thank you for the fast shipping!
2292,It fits really good!
2293,Very well made and cute! The colors aren't as vibrant in person but still very cute!
2294,"Not crazy about ordering two different sizes to see which one fits, only to find out that there are no returns."
2295,I can't tell you how happy I was when these caftans arrived! Very sexy shape and perfect length.....LOVE LOVE LOVE!
2296,"This a very beautiful beach cover up!!
Because I am a tiny person, I need to make it a little bit smaller.
But I'm very happy with it!!!"
2297,"For an XS, it is a bit roomy, but the cotton is lovely and soft. I look forward to using it as a beach coverup this summer. Delivery from the UK was very swift."
2298,"Fits well, love the design and embroidery. Simple and elegant."
2299,"Beautiful kaftan, can't wait for the summer now!"
2300,Very nice beach cover up. Order a size up. It's a bit small.
2301,"This bikini is PERFECT!!! Honestly I was a little hesitant because I'm typically a little picky about how bikinis fit (mostly because i have a larger bust, 36 D) but I am so In love with my graffiti bikini! The fit is amazing. seriously so comfortable. I want to wear it all the time! The color is gorgeous too! Rose was great and answered all my questions before the purchase. So happy! Thanks Rose!!!"
2302,"Perfect fit (I got an XS, I am a 34A), amazing bright color, and was exactly what I was looking for.  Jumped off the top of a pirate ship/bar in the ocean and not once did the top shift or fall off. Fast shipping, owner was a sweetheart and very responsive to my questions and worked with me to make sure I got the best fit possible.  Am 100% buying from her again!!!!"
2303,Beautiful top! The color is bright and vibrant and the material feels strong.. I hope for many warm en sunny summers to come!!
2304,"This is such a flattering top on me even though I have a small chest, and it got to me in like 2 days! I'm in love with it. Rose was also super helpful and timely answering my questions :)"
2305,It fits perfectly and the color is stunning!! Thank you so much Rose!
2306,"LOVE love love the colour, fits perfectly & super comfortable. I had to come back for more so i've ordered a few other colours in this style! Have already worn it to the beach & pool and is an awesome top. Really surprised at how quick postage to Aus was too!"
2307,This top is fantastic. It fits comfortably and hold everything in. I'm a 34D and the large top is absolutely perfect. I am for sure buying another top coming summer time!(:
2308,"Shipping was super fast to the Gold Coast, Australia. Bikini material feels awesome, and is made well. Top fits but if it isn't done up tight enough water gets in and can drag the top down. Maybe I'm not large enough in the bust department
 Super comfy too. Was very easy to deal with and great customer service."
2309,So cute! I am a 34 D and a large fit perfectly!
2310,"Bought the matching bottoms as well and love them both! I get so many compliments on the stunning back design of the top. I can’t get enough of this bikini, it’s definitely my favorite suit I’ve ever owned. Shipped promptly, arrived well packaged. I am totally buying from this seller again!"
2311,Love this top! It is the best thing I have found for extra support!
2312,"Rose went far and beyond to help me and I always got a quick response from her to my questions. I exchanged the pink top for a bigger size without problem. The shipping was fast!! This is my message to Rose: I just received the tops and they are gorgeous. I already loved the pink color but the royal blue is perfect. It's exactly what I want. Thank you very much for your help and answering my questions so fast. I will definitely buy my swimsuits from you and recommend you. Thanks again

Aloha ?"
2313,I absolutely love it! it came in a short amount of time and fits perfectly!
2314,Such a beautifully hand crafted suit! It feels secure and like it will stay in place! Rose was so nice and had a quick response to my questions. I will definetely be buying my next suit from her. High quality product that made me feel sexy and excited!
2315,Love this top! I feel it runs a little on the small side and has no padding. The shop has great customer service and worked with me when I was in a bind. I would highly recommend ordering a top from this shop!
2316,Thank you! It was great to be able to customize my bikini with Rose. Gorgeous and will send photos once I get it on the beach!
2317,Great support! Size chart is accurate and I am more than happy with how fast I received the product.

2338,Good quality and fit true to size. Very happy.
2339,Absolutely perfect! I'm in love with my top. Fits perfectly and looks beautiful on. I couldn't be any happier with my purchase :) and will definitely be purchasing again
2340,Thank you so much for your amazing skills its looks so beautiful on and its exactly how it looks in the picture but even better on!
2341,This top is SO beautifully made. It didn't work out just because I didn't like how it personally looked on me (though I really wish it did!!!) Regina was a huge help with all of my questions and concerns.
2342,I love the top! Fits really well and the adjustment method is perfect for wider ribcages. Definitely thinking about grabbing the white one next!
2343,"love how it was very welcoming, the note was extremely professional I will definitely be purchasing more, it looks and fits great by the way, thank you!"
2344,I LOVE this top! It shows a bit more skin than I'm used too but I love the way it fits me. It's so soft and I don't have to worry about the 'girls' falling out. The hand written card that came with the package was a great touch as well. I would recommend!
2345,Regina is amazing and so helpful! I got this is sage and the fit and color are perfect! Can't wait to show it off!
2346,It is a perfect fit
2347,Love it.
2348,"it's exactly what i was looking for, super cute!!"
2349,"very cute and well made! arrived quickly. 

:)"
2350,So lovely. Cozy. Beautiful. Sexy. Thank you.
2351,Très beau comme sur la photo
2352,Was finally able to open and try it on this week since it arrived when I own away on work. It is absolutely lovely and I can't wait to start wearing it :)
2353,Very sweet and cooperative store owner!
2354,"the quality is good,the piece looks very nice but the fit is unflattering. The middle of each cup is cutting a little into the breast - so the shape of the breast seems strange."
2355,Bought a size 18 perfect fit for you if you are busty and want something modest. I am 5’ and 170 lbs after having my son. This is great.
2356,LOVE it! So pretty and comfortable! True to size. So worth the money!
2357,"I ordered this for my honey moon and bought it in a womens size 4, it got delivered in an extra small!!!! My honeymoon is ruined and there is no time left for me to pursue another back up plan. On top of that it was supposed to be delivered sooner and took an additional 3 days!"
2358,I am a definite size 18 and also 6’3”. I was hoping this would be lose on me but was not. The neckline took some getting used to but the material has plenty of stretch to be comfortable and became slightly looser after 2-3 wears. More modest than most other bathing suits even while being tight on me.
2359,"I usually wear a medium but, after looking at the specs, bought a small. Fits perfectly! I'm looking forward to going swimming soon."
2360,"The place didn't ship me the correct color, wanted me to buy it again plus charge my credit card again. Wouldn't expedite the shipment. I had to ask for a shipping label, never got it. Never heard from them again. Never offered anything to compensate their error. Poor customer service. I will never buy from this place again. They are running a business fraudly. I never got my black dress. Very disappointed. They need to be reported to the BBB."
2361,The good witch worked with me on everything . I'm leaving for Disney soon and only gave about two weeks notice and I got my bathing suit on time. It's so perfect to. I love it 😍 couldn't ask for a better bathing suit to show off in Disney !!! THANK YOU Thank you x a million !!!!!
2362,Originally I messaged the seller asking what size to get because the measurements didn’t match up with me on any size. She allowed me to send her my measurements and she made it to fit LIKE A GLOVE! Seriously the comfiest and cutest bathing suit ever. She is incredible and so kind. I got tons of compliments on her work.
2363,"I am soooo in love with my new mermaid bathing suit!! I cannot wait to wear it , it fits perfectly just have to wait for warm weather!!  Hannah is AMAZING! She made a custom order for me i wanted low rise instead of high waisted and she did an amazing job and she was also very sweet and helpful through out the process. Go Hannah!"
2364,Such a cute bathing suit! Im not use to wearing a two piece because of my body but this is great. I love the high waste bottom. Also love that I can look like Ariel. Cannot wait to show this off.
2365,"Love love love love love. It's a perfect fit. It looks adorable. I look like a mermaid. I mean, really. What more do you want? I love this suit so much, and it fits so well, that I'm ordering her wonder woman suit as well."
2366,The swim suit fit so perfectly! I love it so much. I can't wait to wear it this summer. My friends are already jealous of it :D I will definitely shop with the Good Witch again!
2367,"I adore this suit. It is comfortable, well-fitting, and I feel great in it. The design is the perfect balance of cute whimsy without feeling costumey."
2368,I LOVE IT! I don't want to take it off. It fits perfectly and it is very difficult for me to find anything that fits. It's so adorable and unique. I'm so glad I found it and bought it :') Thank you Good Witch :*****
2369,"The Good Witch Clothing has been absolutely amazing to work with! I purchased the Ariel swimsuit and everything arrived when it was estimated to and looked exactly like the listing. I was pleased to find that the quality of the suit was equal to one you'd buy in a store and it was flawlessly made.  Only issue was my bottoms were too big, oh no right? WRONG! In her shipment she had a note advising me to please contact her with any concerns, so I did, and she helped me exchange the bottoms for ones cut a little smaller. Problem solved! How awesome is that? She always answered messages in a timely fashion (and Lord knows I sent her 82 with requests, and ideas, and questions) and was pleasant with each exchange. She was a joy to work with from start to finish. 5 stars for this princess! I HIGHLY recommend this seller and shop."
2370,Super cute outfit : )
2371,Lovely suit and got some lovely comments when I wore it on my disneymoon.
2372,HANNAH IS A GODDESS. Amazing customer service and so easy to communicate with. She tailored the suit bottoms to my measurements (I was between sizes) and they fit *PERFECTLY*. The suit is super flattering and comfortable. I couldn’t love it more!!
2373,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!
2374,Absolutely wonderful! Tons of compliments.
2375,Absolutely love the look of this bikini- looks great on but bottoms come up a little big next time would size down.
2376,"LOVE the bottoms, did find the top a bit odd and unflattering but I think that could’ve been helped if I had bought padding... live and learn!"
2377,I LOVE this suit!  Seller was very friendly and helpful.  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from her again!
2378,Everything went smoothly just thought the top might have a little padding to shape breasts better and give a lil somethin somethin because it was a small
2379,"Taking stars off for communication. The swimsuits themselves look just like the picture. She also was able to get them to me on time as I needed them for a trip, but once she responded to my initial message she completely ghosted me in all communication going forward, as I was inquiring about the tracking information. Make sure you ask all your questions upfront because once you make you transaction you won't receive anymore communication!"
2380,Love this set! So sexy and got it fast! Great communication and easy to work with.  Thank you!
2381,"Thankyou so much!!!!! It fits perfectly, so flattering! :)"
2382,Loooved it! And fast shipping :)
2383,Great quality and fit
2384,"I'm 40 years old and 30 weeks pregnant with my 3rd. I suddenly have awful varicose veins all down my legs (you're cringing at just the thought of the sight, right) and wasn't feeling very confident for our annual trip to aruba this year. I buy swim pants for my 3 year old daughter so i have it a try... These pants are amazing! I could still wear a cute bikini top and show my belly without my unsightly legs.  The custom length and fast, friendly customer service was icing on the cake! thanks so much!!!"
2385,"I am so pleased with the women's swimming shorts that Savannah made for me. After purchasing the first pair I decided to get a second pair to wear to Florida.   I'm not much on a swimsuit and when I found these on line I had several questions for Savannah.  She was always quick to respond to my questions.  I do not sew and had questions about size, length, etc. and Savannah was very patient and just did a wonderful job.  I highly recommend Savannah  and it was a pleasure dealing with her. She Is prompt,  courteous, and the swim shorts are really comfortable.    Thanks again Savannah!"
2386,"Love the nursing swimsuit. Great quality and Savannah used a fabric waistband that I really like. Previously also bought a maternity suit and came back to buy my nursing one because I loved the maternity one so much. Thanks, Savannah!
--Shem's wife"
2387,"I love these swim leggings! They came exactly as ordered, on time, and they're super comfortable."
2388,Perfect! Well made. Exactly what I was looking for. Excellent customer service 💗
2389,fit perfect great fabric super fast shipping
2390,The top is by far the best I have ever wore. Super cute! Comfy too w straps. I think i maybe should've got a small for bottoms but they're good too. Love it
2391,Super Fun Retro Pin up Suit! Love my new bikiniboos! can’t want to buy more! Wore the top under a fitted tank with the bow out after the beach & continued to get compliments!
2392,I love this suit so much!  The swimsuit bottom is so flattering although the bow is a little big for someone not so well endowed.  I'm glad that I can mix and match these pieces with my existing swimsuits.
2393,My suit couldn't have fit any better! Kerry was amazing to work with and she customized my suit just the way I wanted! I will definitely be ordering from her again!
2394,In love with my swimsuit
2395,"I love this bikini! I am five nine so I always seem to have a problem with the length and smaller midsection, I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly and shipped right away. The material of the top is thicker with the bow but the ties on the back lets you adjust the top to fit perfectly. Kerry does a great job on not only the bikini itself but by customizing your experience and providing personal touches herself to the shipment. I will definitely be purchasing another bikini soon!"
2396,"Very well made. The style of the top is more for girls with smaller bust as it adds extra volume and all, so it does too much for me (plus M size fits a little small for 70C), but the bottom is super cute and universal, a classy match for any bikini top. If you buy this, you'll be wearing this for sure. Thank you!"
2397,"Amazing!!! 
Love the material , and the sizing is perfect , I couldn't be more happy , i am amazed that it was delivered so fast, I LOVE it , will definitely order more"
2398,"What a pleasure it was to work with Kerry on this swimsuit. I have never dealt with someone, on Etsy, eBay or other online markets, that has been so kind, easy to work with and helpful. She is SO FRIENDLY and FUN! And, on top of this, her product matches exactly what other users have said: her suits are amazing!!! My suit is so nice--great quality material and fits like a glove. The strap is removable so you can wear the top strapless as well. Flattering on all body types, as I'm a curvy girl. Cannot wait to work with Kerry again!"
2399,I love it! Well done and fast shipped! Bought my ordinary size and it fits perfect! 👌✨
2400,Beautiful suit and she got it to me so quickly in time for my vacation!!! Thank you!!

2413,Love it; super cute! Arrived promptly.
2414,"Well made and good quality. Was received promptly, surprisingly fast considering it came to Wisconsin from the UK! Unfortunately I did return it do to fit issues. My bottom is a bit too curvy for the shape. I would have liked a bit more stretch too."
2415,Was shipped quickly and love the suite!!
2416,Good material just bottoms a little big
2417,Very flattering piece. Thank you!
2418,Thk u .

2430,"Cute, but only flatters certain body types"
2431,Such a perfect suit & I can’t wait to wear it this summer!
2432,"It took almost three weeks to receive the swimsuit. I ordered it on the 10 of May in hopes of receiving it before Memorial Day weekend but didn’t receive it before i left for vacation. When it arrived and I tried it on, the top was too small although it’s the size i always wear. The bottoms fit well. It’s a beautiful swimsuit just hate that I paid so much to not receive it in time and it not fit right."
2433,"Arrived with enough time, bikini top was a bit small but it still stayed put where it needed to!
Super comfy too!"
2434,"Just what I wanted for my first real vacation in a decade. Quality material, fits me like a glove - will definitely buy from this seller again!"
2435,Wonderful bathing suit! Super cute!
2436,"Looks awesome and fits perfectly, I love it!"
2437,"AWESOME ITEM.  Great work, great design."
2438,Love the swimsuit.  The fit is awesome!  Thanks!
2439,Fast shipping - thank you!
2440,Obsessed with this!! We had group of 19 girls order these with Beyoncé lyrics for a catamaran day in Mexico — it was a success!!
2441,Everything is so cute and true to size! Shop is amazing and very prompt to get back to you with any questions! Will definitely be recommending this to friends and revisiting shop!   Xoxo
2442,Really loved this bathing suit. I was pleseantly surprised at how well it fit. I would say it's true to size. We rocked these in Mexico! All eyes on us!
2443,"I was worried these wouldn't fit well, but all 8 bridesmaids agreed they were perfect! I ordered a large (size 6/8, 5'10) and it was great!"
2444,I absolutely love it!! Came super quick and is just the way I wanted it! I get compliments on it all the time! Thanks:)
2445,"Ordered a 3x for
sister and she wears a size 18. She says material is soft, stretchy enough and fits great. Thanks !"
2446,LOVE IT!
2447,"Must use, they were great!!"
2448,The fit was perfect and I loved this item. Recommended!
2449,"I Loved the color! It was vibrant received lots of compliments. However, I wish there was a cheeky cut think it would give a better shape but nonetheless it was a great buy."
2450,great fit! Perfect for my bridesmaids!!
2451,The order came in PERFECTLY for 23 bathing suits. Very impressive and the quality is awesome!!!!
2452,Loved!!
2453,"Shipped quick and received it early! Print was written correctly and had great placement. Fit was good - could have a little more stretch. There is also NO padding in the suit, so make sure that is what you are looking for! Super cute."
2454,The swimsuit arrived within 2 weeks and fit perfectly (I was nervous because the size charts were a bit confusing). The quality is great and the print too. I can't speak to longevity because I just got it. Smooth transaction and I'm please with my purchase.
2455,"I LOVE my bathingsuit, seller was also accommodating with shipping date"
2456,Love it! Had photoshoot done in the suit. I’ll send once I get them. Great material. Thank you.
2457,"Love these suits! I ordered about 20 of these for a bachelorette party and they were a huge hit. If in doubt, size up-- they are a little short in the torso."
2458,"Shipped swiftly, super comfy. Just what I needed and great customer service."
2459,So so cute! Thank you.
2460,"Exactly what I wanted!
Thanks so much!!"
2461,Lettering just as I asked.
2462,Highly Recommend this shop ! Delivered super fast; faster than expected. The swimsuit is of great quality from the material to the wording & it’s inexpensive. Can’t wait to wear it.
2463,Love it! Exactly as pictured
2464,Great customer service and fast shipping. Great quality
2465,"Runs a little small but other than that, loved it!"
2466,looks great and quality is as desired!
2467,"Fast delivery, good quality, cute idea!"
2468,It turned out good but the sizing is funky. It's loose on top so I'll have to tighten up the straps. Other than that the shipping was as expected and quality okay.
2469,Straps fit a little weird. But all and all a great buy !
2470,"Was exactly what i ordered,  made a fantastic present for my girlfriend."
2471,Shipped very quickly! Fits perfect!
2472,Ordered mine in baby pink. It came out cute but the color was slightly see through when dry and completely see through when wet.
2473,As shown and fits like a glove.
2474,Very nice but you will need to size up!
2475,Fast delivery! Very Satisfied.
2476,Very low cut in the front.
2477,A gift and she loved it. A+
2478,"Don’t order from this shop. They spelled one item wrong, took forever and the suits are horrible quality. Terrible."
2479,"It is a really beautiful cut, very unique and perfect quality!!! Thx a lot !"
2480,"Love, love, love this bathing suit! Just as sexy as in the picture, and the material is very sturdy while also remaining stretchy. I definitely be coming back to this store."
2481,"I adore my swimsuit! Shipping was swift, service stellar, and the swimsuit of great quality. I strongly recommend this seller."
2482,Love it !!!!
2483,"I am a 30 F, so I ordered an XL and I couldn't be happier, this fits perfect! Full coverage is what I wanted and they succeeded! I only wish that it was lined thicker to help conceal the nipples after getting wet."
2484,"I ordered this beautiful bikini top but unfortunately (because I'm a plus-sized female) I wasn't comfortable enough wearing it because of the open back. Fortunately, the return process was super easy and the customer service was phenomenal. Drea was so helpful and kind and I can't wait to recommend this shop to my friends :-)"
2485,Very beautiful bikini top and fits perfectly. Everything worked out great with the extra lining. Thank you!
2486,"Great seller, so helpful!! Great quality top!"
2487,Way to small even a large for a size 38DDD. absolutely no support for under the boobs because you couldn't tighter under around the boob area and ribs. I had even emails the shop owner and told her my size and if it would fit. She never responded to my question but only said size large and I asked again if it would fit my size and no response to that. She was great when I wanted to return it after I received it.
2488,Wish I knew it has threading over the nipple area. The owner did offer exchange tho but not enough time to exchange .
2489,"If I could give more than 5 stars I would! I am allergic to elastics and synthetic materials and have been searching for years for a cotton swimsuit. IFFIcreations went above and beyond in customer service to help me have my very first cotton swimsuit! Not only does it not burn me, but is it really cute and I didn't have to give up any of the beautiful style to have one. For the fist time in my life I have been playing in water all summer long with my family. I have a gorgeous suit and it doesn't burn me. I have been in the water more than I ever thought I would this summer and the swimsuit is holding up so well. I have already ordered more! Thank you! I don't have enough words to say thank you for what you have given me!"
2490,"Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!  I cannot WAIT to romp around and show this off! The color is beautiful and vivid, and the materials used overall great quality. You make a lovely product, and the care you take in its creation is evident. Thank you, Iffi! XO"
2491,Im super happy with this tankini set that arrived yesterday and I will definitly get another bikini set within the month as an extra set.
2492,"I especially love the print on the bottoms. It's a lot more subtle than I expected, so I like that. Gorgeous packaging and everything smelled freshly laundered which I love."
2493,I loved this swimsuit! Thanks for the last minute orders 👌🏾👌🏾
2494,Fits perfectly!! Arrived on time!! Great shopping experience!!
2495,In Love this cute bikini bottom
2496,"plus sized, and this looks amazing on me."
2497,"your products are amazing and sexy, my girlfriend loved them"

2521,Color is bright and amazing.  Fits as expected.
2522,It fit great! My fiancée loved it
2523,The lady looks stunning in them.
2524,Just as described.   Fit comfortably and looks great.
2525,"This item is amazing, can't wait to wear it  for a complete tan. :)

Thank You"
2526,exactly what I wanted and expected!
2527,Seller showed good customer service when item I purchased fell apart.
2528,Cheaply made. Definitely not worth the money. The material and stitching is not worth what you pay for.
2529,"This bikini was SO beautiful!! I wore it for my honeymoon in Maui. The veil bow part in the back was slightly scratchy and you can't put a dress over it, but I did just great with a wrap skirt."
2530,Wore this on my bachelorette party and it was well received!! Loved it!! So cute for the honeymoon too!!
2531,Probably the most beautiful swim suit I have ever seen. I am beyond excited to show this off at my bachelorette party!!! Thank you SO SO much!!
2532,"Love, love, love"
2533,Thank you for an amazing bikini for my honeymoon! Thanks for quick and kind convos... Would recommend this shop!
2534,This bikini is perfect for my honeymoon!!  Love it!
2535,"Beautiful bikini! 
I ordered the regular cut but it is still very revealing on the bottom which is a little disappointing."
2536,Beautiful bikini!! Love it!!
2537,"I absolutely ADORE this bikini!! The seller was so amazing to me as well. I needed the bikini on time for Spring Break in March. I live in Wisconsin (USA), and she did everything she could to get the product to me on time -- including paying  for the extra shipping fees for it to be expedited! 

The bikini itself is handcrafted, and even has little yellow markers on the insides, so you know which way it is supposed to go. 

Warning: As with any crocheted item, this will not function completely  as a ""normal"" bikini. I did struggle with trying to swim in it and had to retie it numerous times, but that is what you would expect from something crocheted. It is not meant for a lot of swimming, but it IS perfect for lounging, tanning, and spending the day in! It is extremely attractive, and I have gotten so many compliments on it!!"
2538,LOVE!!! Made perfectly to fit me and exactly to my liking. Wore for spring break and had tons of comments! Amazing seller and even more amazing products 😍
2539,This seller is absolutely amazing! I changed my mind at the last minute and asked if she could make it in a different color. It is absolutely beautiful work and fits perfectly! I am beyond pleased with her work and customer service. I would highly recommend ordering from her!
2540,I love my new swimsuit & anxious to wear it this summer.  I’m already wearing the gloves. You’re so sweet to send me those as a gift. Thanks again!
2541,I ordered one for me and one for my mother! The best 👙 bikini s ever!!!! The quality is perfect! I love it!!!! Thank you so much 💓
2542,beautiful bikini. worth the wait.
2543,Ordered April 7th - still hasn't arrived by July 16th. Reading previous reviews I understood I would be waiting a while for this bikini...but now summer is half over. Hoping to receive soon as her products look beautiful.
2544,Beautiful! I can't wait to wear this on the beach. The shop was so helpful and responsive to any questions I had. I definitely will be a repeat customer!
2545,"Item received as described ... my gf absolutely loves it.  It fits her, and is comfortable ... 110% smile.
Thanks"
2546,"Tops are of excellent quality! I appreciate how it accommodates the ""side boob"" issue! I'll be using them to hit the hot sulphur springs in the winter, and then when summer rolls around i'd like to purchase some bottoms! Thank you Regina and I will definitely be purchasing more in the future! Much love!"

2548,In love with this top! I was looking for something unique for my upcoming trip to Mexico and this is perfect! The quality is fantastic and it even came with a hand written note :) I wear a 32/34 B and ordered the B cup and it fits great! I definitely recommend.
2549,the only reason i am giving this bar a 3 is because it does not fit correctly. the customer service was great and i even loved how i got a thank you card along with the purchase but this crochet bralette does not fit right in the slightest :( im sad
2550,Love it! Very cute and fit perfectly.
2551,"Great quality, great seller communication, FAST shipping, thank you!"
2552,I wore this to vegas and everyone was dying over it !
2553,"I love it! It's so edgy and sexy.
Ordered a size small which was a little big. However, it can easily be tailored a bit. I'll definetly order again, but do a custom order so it fits my body like a glove. Thank you 😁"
2554,"I just received my swimsuit yesterday and I immediately put it on. This suit is incredible. It fits  perfect (I didn’t even send in my measurements) and I felt beautiful and sexy. I will definitely be ordering more! Thank you lilysh for making me feel beautiful and sexy!!!! 
💋😘"
2555,thank you for getting this baby to me ! <3 good things take time during busy seasons! I know all too well! thank you for keeping in such great contact and being honest and considerate <3
2556,"It fix so perfect, got so many compliments when I went to Austin on memorial weekend. BreezieStardust was super awesome & sweet! She will reply right away never late replies. Will be buying more stuff from her store. Great service! Wish I can give her 10 stars instead!! (:
Great material, totally worth the wait."
2557,Im in love with my new bikini! Fast shipping too. Thank's!
2558,This is the most beautiful swimsuit I have ever received in my life!! It fits me so perfect I can’t even believe it. The pictures make it look like it was going to be a really tiny crotch area BUT it’s not at all! Perfect for a tall girl like me 🥰
2559,Bikini arrived fast. High quality and stitching is amazing! Thanks for working with me and being so accommodating. Will definitely order from again and recommending to my friends!
2560,Amazing fit and quality 💖 thankyou!!!
2561,Very cute! B star was very helpful and accommodating. Wore so much on holiday. Will be ordering more x
2562,The crotch area is a little baggy on the sides but I really love the fabric & color. It's almost exactly how I thought it'd be !
2563,"Although the seller was extremely responsive, accommodating,  and speedy with the completion and delivery of my order, I was extremely dissatisfied with my purchase. Not only was the item not like the picture (the sides of the bottom have a certain look and my item did not), it was also too big (specifically the internal flap aka the section between your thighs - it was so wide I had to fold it in when I tried it on), badly sewn and made of cheap fabric. Definitely not worth the price or expedited delivery. As a bikini connoisseur, I'm really sad to say this wasn't what I wanted because I've been searching for a high hip bikini for a while now."
2564,"nice color, very flattering on!"
2565,"great fit, I'm 5'2 and 105 lbs. and the XS was perfect"
2566,These are beautifully made. The material is amazing. They are a bit small but I need to drop a few pounds anyway. Shipping took much longer than I was originally told. I am looking forward to losing about an inch from my hips so I can wear them!!
2567,LOVE IT FIT SO WELL
2568,Love the bikini but I'm glad I read the reviews and ordered a size larger
2569,These are beautifully made. The material is amazing. They are a bit small but I need to drop a few pounds anyway. Shipping took much longer than I was originally told and the color I ordered ended up not being available. I was given other options but when I submitted my choice I was then told that color wasn’t available. Finally my next choice was available and they finally shipped. I am looking forward to losing about an inch from my hips so I can wear them!!
2570,This bottom is awesome! I just started wearing super cheeky bathing suits and this is the most comfortable I’ve felt in one. I love how thick the sides of the suit are and it’s flattering in the back
2571,Perfect fit for my bum. Can not wait to wear it next swim season.
2572,I cannot say enough about how much I love this suit! It fits perfectly! I feel confident in a bathing suit for the first time in my adult life. Thank you so very much!
2573,"I feel fabulous in this swimsuit. Thank you, Kerry 😘"
2574,"Material is so soft that it’s a real pleasure to wear this swimsuit. I ordered 2 units, one in summery yellow and another sexy red. Trust me they look even better in reality."
2575,"Always beautiful, form fitting  swim pieces.  

This  is my fourth  swim suit purchased through bikiniboo and  I'm  always very  happy with my purchases.

Excellent quality and  shape enhancing."
2576,"I absolutely love the quality and vintage style of the suit. I am a larger, curvier woman and it hugs all the right places and hides the wrong ones!"
2577,Super cute & comfy! I get so many compliments when I wear it!
2578,"This is the most amazing swimsuit I have ever owned. Beautifully made,  excellent materials. Not to mention how nice the owner is. ❤️"
2579,"Absolutely dreamy! I love this suit because it is so chic, while making me feel comfortable. Also, well made :)"
2580,Gorgeous and fits like a treat! Thank you!
2581,"Like in the pictures (not me, the swimsuit). It's just like to have something unique in your hands. Original, chic and comfortable!!"
2582,Loved it
2583,juste parfait et de très bonne qualité! merci pour cette jolie création
2584,"I have 4 of these swimsuits and I’m sure I’ll get more! Super comfortable, great quality, and always very flattering!"
2585,"Seller is super nice and a great communicator! Swimsuit is beautiful, but I returned it because it's too revealing in the crotch without a gusset sewn in."
2586,Gorgeous swimsuit! I can’t wait to wear it on my upcoming vacation. I do wish the part that ties wasn’t so thick - makes it kind of uncomfortable.
2587,The bathing suit itself is great quality but my top size is way too small to wear it :/
2588,"really nice and well made, fits just right"
2589,Thank you for my order.
2590,"The mustard color looks beautiful, but this swimsuit has zero support."
2591,Awesome swimsuit! Was delivered earlier than expected.
2592,"A beautiful and comfortable swimsuit, just as described :)"
2593,"I loved the bathing suit, seems very well made and it’s super cute. However, and this is my fault for not reading more into the item description, there are no support cups in the fabric and I’m a c cup on the bigger side. Let’s just say I wouldn’t go swimming with this bathing suit but would be nice for tanning."
2594,"Gorgeous goods from Katie. Beautiful shawl, custom made, the color is luscious. The piece is impeccably made of truly high quality material- it’s lush, it’s beautifully designed & expertly crafted. Thank you Katie. It’s wearable art."
2595,Love it! Can't wait to wear it with my bikini!! -L
2596,Beautiful quality-I love the hip scarf!!
2597,Rose is AMAZING!! She was helpful from the start- answering my 500 questions. Then she graciously exchanged my top for me when I ordered the wrong size. The bathing suit is more vibrant and beautiful in person. I'm going to live in this bathing suit this summer!! 🌞
2598,"As I live in Scotland I was quite unsure about ordering a bikini due to possible sizing issues so I decided to message Rose with my measurements! So kind and helpful, with fast replies I was able to select a top and bottom matching set. Rose updated me on how my order was going and when it was to be shipped - it arrived exactly 8 days later! I cannot fault the bikini! It's perfect in every way - the quality, style, fit and colours are all amazing! Can't thank Rose enough for all her help and hard work!

One very happy customer  :)"
2599,Holy booty! These fit like a glove and are very flattering! Love them! Super well made! Can't wait for summer so I can work on my tan lines!!!
2600,I can't explain how much I love this bathing suit!!!! It is very good quality not thin at all and fits great!!! Thank you again!!! You just made my Honeymoon that much better!!
2601,Purchased both the bottoms and the matching top. Absolutely love it! Hugs all the right places and the print/color is perfect for the summer!
2602,"Absolutely love this bathing suit! Fits perfectly, stays in place, super helpful shop and came very quickly! Will definitely be buying again!"
2603,I've finally found a swimsuit bottom that fits well and looks good!  Thanks so much!
2604,"The item arrived MUCH faster than I anticipated, far in advance of my trip as promised! And the swimsuit is gorgeous! The colors are even more vibrant in person! I will definitely shop here again."
2605,Perfect fit. Great quality. Rose responded to my questions in a timely manor and was a pleasure to de al with. I will be ordering more!
2606,"Fits perfectly, as does the top!  Very flattering and keeps everything in place!"
2607,"Rose, 
 The small bottoms fit my daughter perfect. I will have her put it on and send it to you. But they fit like they do on the model and she loves them."
2608,Fits perfectly and makes my body look better than it actually is!
2609,By far my favorite bikini bottom purchase to date! Definitely buying from Graffiti Bikini in the future! :)
2610,MY FAV BIKINI!! YOU ARE AMAZING! THANK YOU SO MUCH!
2611,"Tardó un poco más de lo esperado pero me encanta, muy buena calidad, queda perfecto"
2612,Super cute! My butt looks amazeballs in these bottoms. Couldn't be happier.
2613,Top notch material. Perfect fit will order again
2614,"Fits my Fiance perfectly. Durable, eye-catching, and hands down the best swimsuit I have purchased for her. Rose takes customer service to another level. Thanks again :)"
2615,Fits wonderfully! Love how I feel in these bottoms!
2616,These bottoms hug in all the right places but are not too tight. They are also super comfortable and I love the fabric. The cut is a great balance between showing enough but not too much.
2617,"now that i have this, i will never ever buy a bikini in a normal shop again. great product!"
2618,"Thank you so so much, it fits perfect!!!
Delivery was quick and you were a pleasure doing shopping with :-) x"

2620,awesome bikini great fit rose was really helpful with the sizing
2621,"I've used this pattern several times now and it has made life much simpler.
Thank you"

2623,Great Info and Instructions love it
2624,"Super fast shipping! Fit like a glove! So so pretty, I love the color! I wore this suit for my first bikini competition and had so many compliments on it! Thank you!"
2625,Loved this Suit! Fit Perfect! Definitely felt like a Star on the Stage!
2626,Gorgeous!! Fast shipping!! Can't wait to wear this!!
2627,Really nice suit. Exactly as described.
2628,Shipping was quick and easy BUT i havent even worn it to my show and the bottoms are missing two rhinestones.
2629,"Absolutely adorable!!  I love everything about this swimsuit.  It fits perfectly.  Great communication, McLaine is quick to respond to any question I had.  Will be purchasing again."
2630,"I love the pattern on these! They look well made too with the use of a serger and a sewing machine. I hope they last forever! haha!

They were a bit big in my waist though, but I didn't give her specific measurements, so do that when you order:)"
2631,LOVE!!! Super well made and fit perfectly!! Thank you!
2632,This was beyond AMAZING!!!  Great fit and worth a little wait to get it!!
2633,Beautiful suit. It was worth the wait. Thank you so much. Can’t wait to use it.
2634,Thank you for this awesome bikini bottom. I could tell the quality and craftmanship right away. The size is perfect and I received them just in time for my family vacation. Definitely will shop here again.
2635,"Shipped on time with the policy on her shop, fits perfectly, and looks even better in person than in the pictures."
2636,High quality and awesome fit!
2637,I love this suit. I cannot wait to wear it.
2638,"Fantastic service and happy gift recipient, especially given order was over xmas/new year.  Thanks McLaine."
2639,So much fun! These swimsuits made my 10 year old’s bday party very special! These suits were the “birthday squad” ones. Thank you!
2640,The swimsuits came out just how I wanted ... I am a retuning customer so I’m very satisfied .... Birthday Slay for me & Birthday Squad for my Family
2641,These Swimsuits are PERFECT!! Great Customer Service and Very Helpful !
2642,Looks amazing! Fits a little big but not enough to where I would’ve sized down
2643,I LOVE THE SWIMSUITS! They are PERFECT! Appreciate your great Customer Service and Speedy Delivery! Thanks Again !!
2644,This swimsuit is perfect! We All going to look so matchy lol . Thanks again
2645,"everything worked out, very understanding and reliable! Came out cute*"
2646,CANT WAIT FOR MY GIRLS TO WEAR THESE BIRTHDAY SQUAD SWIMSUITS! They are PERFECT !
2647,Excelent product i recommended for everyone
2648,This product is adorable. I ordered on a Monday and paid extra for rush 2 day shipping. It did not ship out until Friday so I didn't receive it until the next Monday. We therefore sadly were unable to use it for my daughter's party. The seller refunded the rush shipping part but I never would have ordered if I knew it wouldn't ship until Friday despite saying on their page and confirming over message that orders ship in 1-2 days.
2649,"This bathing suit is perfect! It has a lot of stretch to it which makes it very comfortable. As a reference, I'm 5'4, 180 lbs, hourglass shape and I got mine in an XL (which is my bathing suit size for the most part) and it fit like a glove, so I'd say it runs true to size. It also arrived super quick in less than a week. I'm so happy with my purchase and would recommend this seller."
2650,Worked perfect for the 80’s party I went to. Fit perfectly. Thank you so much!!
2651,"Runs a little small if you are on the taller side. Got a Medium (I am 5'10""). Not super cheeky and doesn't cut high either!"
2652,got shipped quick and just like photo love the suit
2653,Really good quality and fits perfect!
2654,könnte an der brust grösser sein
2655,Came super fast! And the seller even made matching bottoms to go with the top! Would definitely buy from again! It fits like a glove and is super comfortable!
2656,Don't mind it. You get what you pay for. Love the colour!
2657,This bikini was amazing! The lady also made me a matching bottom. She was kind and I received it quickly! I definitely recommend!!!
2658,"It took a bit of maneuvering to figure out how to put the bikini on the correct way. I would recommend that girls with smaller boobs (like me, I'm a 34B/36A) get an XS. I got a Small and it kept sliding down all day. I'm pretty sure I exposed some nip a few times. But it's good quality and looks cute!"
2659,This item is great! And shipped quickly!! Thank you!!
2660,Color not as pictured at all. The green is actually yellow and the pink is a very light pink. Like a highlighter pink.
2661,"Had weird strings in the front(not in picture), smelled horrible of smoke, material was ok but definitely not worth the price."
2662,This item was so very tiny. Not sure what sizes are in Turkey but not even close to US sizes. Also not neon green or neon pink. It is a Yellow and a pinkish coral color.
2663,"I thought I had left a review on this. My wife received this top an immediately feel in love with the fabric and, style, and color. This is a such a nice top ....very well made ."
2664,I absolutely love my bikini & Aniko! She was very sweet & fun to work with! Loved her & my bikini sooo much that I purchased another one!
2665,It is very cute and was shipped in a timely manner. Top is still slightly smaller than I expected but works anyway.
2666,Very beautiful and wonderful of the best raw materials
2667,"I’m blown away!!! This is the most well made, best fitting swimsuit I’ve ever had! It’s exactly what I wanted and I will order another one ASAP!  Made for my body, perfectly comfortable, and extremely flattering! I’m going to tell all my friends and send more business to Tribe! Super stoked!!"
2668,I love the cut and it’s right on my size. thanks To Anthony for taking the right measurements and it’s Absolutely comfortable!
2669,I absolutely love my swimsuit!! It fits perfectly. So beautiful and so comfortable! Anthony made sure I got my order before I left for vacation.
2670,This is one of the best swim suit purchases I have made in a while. It looks great and fits like a glove. Would buy more products.
2671,Loved it. A beautiful swimsuit that makes you feel sexy yet covered
2672,Love the bikini top.  Fits well.  I added breast pads for a little more support.  I initially gave an old address and emailed seller with current address and item was shipped to correct address.  Thank you seller!
2673,Love this top and shipping all the way from Turkey was very fast.  Will DEFINITELY buy from this seller again !
2674,It ended up being smaller than I would like
2675,"Fits so well!! The material is great, colors pop, and the seams are strong and done well. I was worried the front would angle too low but it's the perfect amount of fabric to not be too revealing. Really love the rouching in the back too!"
2676,Looks great on the floor!  😎
2677,Absolutely LOVE this suit! It fits perfectly and is so flattering! Can't wait to order it in more colors!
2678,"TBC- I got the black double strap bikini bottom in another picture. Fit is perfect, quality even better. Quick processing and delivery, cant wait to wear and order again . Thank you!!"
2679,"Shipped quickly, just as pictured. Love this color and material it feels great on my skin. Can't wait to wear this!! Seller is very communicative and friendly. Thank you :)"
2680,Such a perfect fit. Fixed and returned to me super fast! I'll be ordering more!
2681,My daughter loves this bikini top and it fits her perfectly! Thank you.
2682,"Love it! It's the most comfortable top 
Bikini I have ever bought! Really flatter to the body! Probably will get another one in different color.. 
It will be awesome if you could offer more colors and fabric to this figure:) thank you! ❤️"
2683,Love it! The only bathing suite I wont share with my friends. Looks really great on and the material is very soft.
2684,"I love the style of this baithing suit. Once it gets wet it stretches out a little too much to get in any waves with this suit. It's more of a lay out in the pool kind of suit unless you don't care about pulling it up and adjusting the bottoms 10 times before getting out of the pool. I'm 5'3"" 140 sporty built and would buy smaller  bottoms next time cause the cuteness over weighs the practicalness! The price is also very reasonable and the owner is very responsive."
2685,Super cute top and she even adjusted the size for me a bit to better fit my measurements. The only thing I would like better is it there was light padding since I'm on the smaller size otherwise it fits great!
2686,Love it!
2687,"Shipped on time, looks even better than I imagined, fits great!! Definitely shopping here again ❤️"
2688,Quick shipping. Cute suit. Not the best swimsuit material but I like it on
2689,"Just as described, looks and feels great.  Thank you..."
2690,The second one I bought! Very satisfied!!
2691,This top is super comfortable.
2692,I love the way the top looks but wished they would have put a thin layer of padding for when you get cold.
2693,Small in size but cute and well made!
2694,"Love it, thank you thank you ..."
2695,"Very beautiful and simple, fits great!"
2696,Super cute bathing suit and fast shipping! Thanks a bunch!
2697,It keeps everything in place. There will be more orders in my future!
2698,Commandé en blanc. Conforme à la photo.
2699,"Shipped on time, comfy and cute!"
2700,"This swimsuit is ABSOLUTELY stunning!!!!! I’m a 6’, 200+ lb. woman and I swear, if it looks good on me, it will look good on anyone!!!!! The convertible straps are SUPER long, so even someone as long as me can make some pretty complex wraps! A fantastic, 100% versatile suit. Also, don’t be afraid of your top falling out! I measure from a DD-G depending on the brand, and I feel completely secure in the top!"
2701,First of all I have to say I am in love with this swimsuit!! I had put on a bit of weight and was looking for a swimsuit that was stylish but also covered up what I didn't want seen and this swimsuit does it. The back and front cut at the leg isn't deep at all and sits beautifully. You can play around with the top bit so technically you can 'wear' a different swimsuit everyday when you're on holiday! I love it!! To top it off Elizabeth is such a sweetheart! I will definitely be getting my swimsuits from her in the future!
2702,This is by far the best swimsuit I’ve ever had. I have the black suit and I can’t wait to get more colors ! I get so many compliments and I feel so amazing when I wear it. Plus  she shipped it so quickly ! Amazing customer service and a very happy customer !
2703,"For the first time ever, I feel confident and glamorous in a swimsuit. This suit is well made and flattering, especially for women with hips and breasts.  Buy this and don't think twice. Thank you so much to Elizabeth for being helpful and responsive."
2704,"THis is a brilliant swimming costume and I love how versatile it is, I also need to be able to breastfeed and this will do marvellously for that too. I look forward to trying it out on holiday next month. Looks great on. Thank you."
2705,"Bathing suit is beautifully constructed with nice, substantial fabric. I sent Elizabeth my measurements and it fits perfectly! 
Great seller communication and item arrived earlier than estimated. 
Very happy with the purchase and would absolutely buy from this shop again!"
2706,I love this. I have to practice the multi-ways but I am sure in summer I will order another colour too. Now I have a black one and simply love it. Good quality fabric and perfect fit. I am size plus and tall (1.80m). I can really recommend this swimsuit from my heart.
2707,This swimsuit is stunning! Really quick response from Elizabeth and fast delivery too!
2708,Great workmanship and quality very 😁
2709,SO BEAUTIFUL!
2710,Stunning in person! Great quality & fast shipping :)
2711,Fantastic quality!! Absolutely beautiful.
2712,Good customer service . Will shop again.
2713,These are perfect and I can’t wait to see them on stage!
2714,Amazing! Looks just as pictured and looks perfect on. The size was spot on and I asked her to raise the bottoms to make them a little cheekier and she did and I am in love! Now hopefully I will make it to a pool one day soon so I can try them out! I will definitely shop here again!
2715,"I got this in the mail and tried it on immediately. I was alone in my apartment and literally proclaimed out loud "" HA I AM A MERMAID"" as soon as I had it on. This swimsuit is really cute and looks really well made. The high waist bottoms come above the belly button and hide my fat pouch so well. The back is also super cute. It is such a unique suit and I can't wait to wear it out!"
2716,"I am a curvier girl, so as much as I'm learning to love my body, I still want to cover it up a bit. It's the middle of winter, but as soon as I got my package I ran and tried these bottoms on and I cannot WAIT for summer!!! I have red hair and have always been obsessed with mermaids, so needless to say, I will look like Ariel this summer and I am so ok with that. These bottoms hide my belly bumps perfectly while still looking feminine and fun. I am so so pleased and excited for warmer days!"
2717,It fit great and was very comfortable! Perfect suit for my Disney Cruise! Only issue is I wore it in the ocean and the glitter started coming off onto my skin. Still so cute though!
2718,They're SO sparkly and vibrant! Hooray! And the fit was spot on - there isn't as much stretch as other swimwear that I've owned so I'm thankful I ordered the right size :) Can't wait to wear them! It took 10 days from ordering until delivery and that's perfect!
2719,"Gorgeous suit, fit perfectly! Nice and sparkly and worked well for my pear shaped body type"
2720,Love my my new bottoms!! They fit like a glove. Hannah is a true sewing goddess!
2721,"Amazing! Super comfortable! The only swimsuit bottom I've ever had that doesn't ride up. The craftsmanship is beautiful, and the quality is great! Definitely recommend!"
2722,I love it so much! The quality is great and it fits exactly right. Thank you.
2723,Perfect fit! It's so well made too! I'm looking forward to summer now with these !!!
2724,"These are fabulous - quality fabric, true to size and cutecutecute!  The Good Witch even tweaked the design a little for me - she rocks.  Shipping was quick despite my having the wrong address initially.  Five STars!"
2725,LOVE these!! By the time I had saved up the money and committed myself to getting them they had gone out of stock so I messaged the shop owner and she relisted them just for me!! Doesn't cost extra to get it based on your measurements and turned out great. Loved ordering from you and will definitely be back soon!!
2726,Love love love!!!
2727,"These swim bottoms are perfect! The fabric and finish of the product are great quality. I asked for custom measurements and these fit like a glove; so flattering! So excited to wear these! Thank you for great customer service, fast delivery and a wonderful item!"
2728,"They were absolutely beautiful and fit perfectly! Thank you so much, will definitely shop here again."
2729,These are beautiful. They looked exactly like they do in the picture. Fit was perfect! I really appreciated the hand written note too :) I can't wait to rock these on the river! Thank you so much Hannah!
2730,"So in love. Sparkly, well fit, and quality material. Fast shipping too. ????"
2731,"Absolutely perfect! Love the item and the shop owner was super nice and answered my questions right away, and even re-listed the item for me. Will be wearing these forever :P"
2732,"Love it!!! Fits me perfectly, and is soooo cute! Couldn't be happier with the customer service."
2733,These are the cutest bottoms I ever purchased!! I couldn't wait to wear them for pride yesterday! I wish I could post a photo for you to see!
2734,"The seller was awesome, very friendly and responded quickly to all my questions...the bottoms are true to size and fit perfectly, plus  they're super cute!"
2735,"These bottoms are so cute! I received many compliments when I wore them on my birthday. They are made well, and are so comfortable. If you are a mermaid lover, I highly recommend them!"
2736,Fits perfectly! !
2737,Hannah is awesome and I ordered one that ended up too big. She fixed it for me and sent it back super quick! I love it! Thank you!
2738,"Hannah was wonderful with working with me to make the bottoms I wanted! She was quick to respond, flexible and made the bottoms exactly how I wanted them to fit.!I'll be back for other events most definitely."
2739,"this was my first time ordering clothing from etsy. I was pretty nervouse, But it fits perfectly. Defently ordering from this gal again ."

2766,"shipped on time, cut on the legs was a bit wonky but in good condition"
2767,beautiful piece! thank you so much! i love it!
2768,"It fits very well and really suits my figure (which is hard to find). Not only that, it's also very stylish!"
2769,"Love this, it made my husband smile (win)!  It took about 3 weeks to arrive, consistent with what I was told when I ordered.  Can’t wait to wear it this summer!"
2770,die größe haette besser sein koennen
2771,"Isn't exactly like the pictures but I love it! Handmade which is really nice, thank you!"
2772,"This top doesn’t fit like the picture above at all, I contacted the seller to tell her the size was incorrect and never got a response, it’s been months."
2773,"Got to me very fast! 
But just know High cut, means VERY high cut! Haha! Thanks guys."
2774,"5’3 125 lbs (35; 27; 37) the medium fits perfect. Amazing customer service! I reached out to see if I could pay for fast shipping to get it before my trip and here it is ready to go! Thank you so much you saved me, lol."
2775,"The suit looked amazing on me, literally fit perfectly. I'm a curvier gal and I was so happy to find a shop that accommodates any size girl. I'm going on a bachelorette cruise party and all the girls got suits with sayings on them. This is literally the perfect suit and very flattering."
2776,"We had a pretty big order for  bachelorette party, with all different colors, fonts, and quotes- and PrettyRobesShop accommodated all of our requests and the bathing suits were super cute! They were shipped surprisingly fast."
2777,"Swimsuit ended up perfectly, and got to me in plenty of time! Thanks so much!"
2778,"I’m so happy with this swim suit! The material is really high quality, the cut is perfect- higher cut so it doesn’t construct your butt cheeks like some one pieces do, and the shipping was on time!"
2779,"The one piece is absolutely perfect! I’m beyond obsessed and can’t wait to wear it! Also, I got this item crazy fast, thank you!!"
2780,Hanna was spectacular! Customer service was out of the park. Great quality swimsuits and the customization! Would HIGHLY recommend!!
2781,"Shipped very fast, I ordered 13 bathing suits for a bachelorette party and they all came out perfect!"
2782,"Awesome customize swimsuits, ordered for a girls trip they did not disappoint, true to size & fast shipping will definitely order again & recommend their service without hesitation!"
2783,"I love it,it fits perfect,the writing is just the way i wanted and grear quality!(pic is in the mirror so it's backwards lol)"
2784,Sizing is about perfect. I weigh 120 5’3 and I ordered a small. Comes with nice built in pads too.
2785,"Love this swimsuit! Great quality, thick material. I personally love the cups (bonus), and this suit is NOT see through which is great since it is white. I also love the hi-cut style, very flattering. The seller was quick to respond to me with very cute options for the front (I got it for my bachelorette). Amazing item and customer service. Definitely would recommend."
2786,"This swimsuit came out perfectly!! The material is actually super high quality and I love that it has removable padding. The back is a low scoop which adds a bit of fun to a one piece. Highly recommend this shop, they were very patient in getting the wording and spacing correct through a few revisions of the artwork."
2787,Probably the best bathing suit quality I’ve ever purchased and the shipping was so fast!! Will definitely buy my custom suits here every year!
2788,"I am so pleased with the service provided and the quality of this bathing suit ! I ordered a size M and it is true to size. It is VERY high wasted so it shows a lot  of booty. 

Absolutely love this !!!"
2789,LOVE LOVE LOVE! Super cute baiting suits for my girls and I for a Bach party. The padding is an extra bonus💜💜💜 obsessed !
2790,My swimsuit was perfect. The design was beautiful and it was perfect fit. I ordered a small based on the size guide and it worked perfectly for me at 5ft 112lbs. It was a pleasure working with this seller. Will update my review with pics later.
2791,"Great quality product. Impressed with the tight pull on the material. Hi cut and comes up high on the back,so it's a flattering fit. Seller easy to communicate with to get it just how you want it. Surprised friends for our Girls Trip and they were a big hit! I ordered mine first to get a feel for the other sizes. In short, get your regular size!! Red and Rose Gold are Medium and Yellow/Green/Blue are Large. I'm in yellow and 180lbs and size 12/14 and large was perfect. Almost felt like I could've gotten the medium for a tighter snatched look,but that very well may have been pushing it. LOL Anyway,don't hesitate♥️"
2792,"This turned out perfect! I am usually a s/m, but decided to go with small because I am flat chested. The small fit great!"
2793,"Gorgeous! They are great quality, the colors are so bright and beautiful. Couldn’t have been any happier."
2794,"Super cute! But heads up, it runs small! Just for reference, I ordered a L and am 5’8 & 152lbs and it riiiiiides up. Not sure if an XL would work or not since I’m worried it prob would’ve been too large. But maybe just be cautious if you’re tall. Overall, the material is good and the communication with the seller was great!"
2795,Definitely recommend! Fit so perfectly and it was so comfortable. I love the one piece aspect and the straps stayed up on my shoulders well.
2796,Perfect fit
2797,"PrettyRobesShop is amazing! They were fast, professional, and answered every question/change I had. The swimsuits arrived much fast than anticipated and the quality, font, and colors are perfect. Thank you!"
2798,"Customer service was great, order got here in time! Lastly, the bride loved both of her suits! The fit is perfect!! Go one size up cause they do run small."
2799,"Thankful for this company!
Loved my bathing suit"
2800,"Love the bathing suit! Thank you! I was able to get exactly what I want printed on the bathing suit (wording and font). The only thing is I wish I had sized up. The bathing suit fits but it’s not as comfortable as I would like. I would recommending sizing up, especially if you’re tall. I’m not even tall (5’ 2”) and a small feels as if it’s stretching to fit my height."
2801,We love our suits! They look just like the picture.
2802,"This was an awesome purchase. They are so helpful if you need assistance and my suit got here so quick! It’s really good quality as well. If you’re looking for a fun custom swim suit, I highly recommend this shop!"
2803,Seller was super responsive and sweet! I love the suits too. I got them in rose gold and they’re cute and flattering!
2804,Great suit! The seller was super responsive and made the design exactly how I requested it. The suit is super cute and not see-thru. Can’t wait for my bachelorette!
2805,Love it!!!
2806,"Very helpful with quick delivery. I would say size up in swim in you have a bigger chest. I am a 34DDD and ordered a large, but definitely could’ve used a XL for the breast area."
2807,Exactly what I requested for my baby moon! Quick shipping!
2808,The swimsuit it’s self fits perfect and good quality. But this is a customized item and my text is off center which looks - odd
2809,"Definitely high cut on the sides, in the front and in the back, BUT very well made, high quality and shipping was fast! Communication was very good in getting these custom made, quick and thorough responses. I was afraid they would be cheaply made and I would be falling out of it, but everything stays in its place!"
2810,I ordered 6 bathing suits for my best friends bachelorette and I’m in love ! Good material and they arrived so quickly. Thank you Hannah and Leonie! Will definitely order again
2811,Loved them! Thank you..can't wait to use them at my bachelorette party!
2812,"Super cute, super high cut!"
2813,"I love this shop! They were great and executed exactly what I wanted, the quality of these suits surpasses others I've found online. Would purchase again from here."
2814,"I love this shop! They were great and executed exactly what I wanted, the quality of these suits surpasses others I've found online. Would purchase again from here."
2815,"I love this shop! They were great and executed exactly what I wanted, the quality of these suits surpasses others I've found online. Would purchase again from here."
2816,They all turned out great. Get your normal size. Letters stayed on well too
2817,"Customer service is great!! 
The fit of the bathing suit is on point (go one size up) 
Lastly, the customizable lettering I loveeee! I will come back to add pictures once the bride has it on. :) 
Thank you so much!"
2818,Shipped really fast and were so fun for my friend's bachelorette!!
2819,I LOVE this suit! Great quality and the company was very quick to respond on any questions I had! Definitely recommend :)
2820,The suit is absolutely adorable and exactly what I was expecting!
2821,Great fit and so happy I could get my friends company logo!!
2822,"Shipping and customer support were great. When I received my suit, the font was way bigger than I expected, maybe because I only had one short word. It is fine, but a digital proof may have helped that. 
I think the suit is probably best for those with larger chests - I am a small b cup but there is gaping on the sides near the armpit. I am 5'2 and ordered a size small, which fits great in all other areas.
All in all, get's the job done for a $20 one piece!"
2823,Great order 😊 They were speedy and detail oriented. I will say sizing was tricky with this. Online I should be a size M but ordered a L just to be safe. Ended up being just about right. So I’d say error on the bigger size side. I’m typically a 6 in my bottom half and I wear a 36 C.
2824,"GREAT PURCHASE 💕 These are surprise gifts for my sisters and they came out perfect. The shop owners are amazing, I accidentally forgot to change the delivery address when I changed my payment methods AND THEY WERE GOING TO GET SHIPPED TO ONE OF MY SISTERS! The shop was quick to respond and made sure the change was made, life savers!"
2825,"GREAT PURCHASE 💕 These are surprise gifts for my sisters and they came out perfect. The shop owners are amazing, I accidentally  forgot to change the delivery address when I changed my payment methods AND THEY WERE GOING TO GET SHIPPED TO ONE OF MY SISTERS! The shop was quick to respond and made sure the change was made, life savers!"
2826,Perfect for my birthday party! Was able to get rush shipping so it would come in time for the big day. Great customer service and great product.
2827,"Good communication skills,very professional,good service.I love it!!!! Thank ya'll so much.."
2828,Loved this suit! Looks great and fits well. A good quality suit and well worth the price.
2829,"Swimsuits look and fit as true to size.  However, after the first time wearing the swimsuit the words crack and started to peel on some of the swimsuits."
2830,"Ordered for my upcoming bachelorette party. Shop was very responsive and the product shipped quickly! Very cute and good quality. Would recommend sizing up, especially if you are on the taller side."
2831,Excellent quality and great seller! It even has cups inside!!
2832,Swimsuit looks great! But warn that transparency over accurate shipping times is quite poor (this was ordered several weeks before the current health crisis as a disclaimer).
2833,fits like a glove...high quality swim suit and lettering...love it!!!
2834,Quality suits but I recommend to SIZE UP!  We ordered 8 suits and followed the size chart exactly. The shop followed up with me quickly and resolved the issue. I would order from this shop in the future. Quality suits and service!
2835,Super cute. High cut and looks just like the picture
2836,Love the suit and quick response. I will say the white I got for my bachelorette isn’t lined in the bottom so I think I’ll have to line it myself. Not an issue with the shop but something to think about if you’re getting a light color. I’ll be updating with pictures of me and my cute bridesmaids soon!
2837,"Ordered a set of swimsuits for a bachelorette party and everything turned out well. Great quality and really pleased with customer service as well. 

I would also size up for a better fit."
2838,Loved it!! Was exactly what I wanted!
2839,Shipped SOOO fast and was exactly what I expected!
2840,"Have not worn it in the water yet, which is why I gave 4 stars. Shipped very quickly. The shop owner stayed in communication. No complaints"
2841,Loved it. Very flattering on a body that I'm not always crazy to show off.
2842,"Great quality suit, very vibrant hot pink!"
2843,Love the fit and lettering
2844,Great quality swimsuit! The turnaround time was quick.
2845,Haven’t tried it on yet but I am obsessed!!!!!
2846,This is my second custom swimsuit order and it’s just as great as the first. Fit and quality is consistent!
2847,Seller was very friendly. Shipped fast. Great material
2848,"Quick shipping, exsctly what i was looking for! Loved the bright colors, too"
2849,LOVE my swimsuit- it turned out exactly as I hoped. Very friendly and responsive to my questions before I even placed the order.
2850,"Great quality, I just wish the text was a little higher as it hits where my stomach is instead of my chest."
2851,"Bathing suits were as described. The yellow color is more golden, which I liked. From time I placed my order to time of delivery, it took about 3 weeks. I would order again."
2852,"Ordered a “fiancé” suit to wear on a trip. Came in super quick, just in time!! But it came in saying “fiancée” instead of “fiancé” so I message the shop about my situation, thinking oh well innocent mistake I’ll get another. They offer me 20% refund and gave me googled definitions of the words fiancé and fiancée... It doesn’t matter what Google says the definition is? I ordered a personalized suit that specifically said “fiancé”.  So to the other fiancé’s, I would support a different business to get your suits. This one may make unwanted changes to your order and be difficult."
2853,Very nice quality!! She loves it
2854,"This item was great for the purpose. We got them for my friend’s bachelorette. It shipped in about 2 weeks, which I accounted for so that was fine. The only reason I am not giving this suit 5 stars is because the letters were threatening to peel off right when I took it out of the box (they didn’t, though) and the sizing was difficult to decipher what size would be best for me. I am between a small and a medium and I ordered the small but it just made the cut. It was also super cheeky but hey, it was a bachelorette!"
2855,"It was okay, customer service not that responsive, messaged a few times a week before I needed to use the bathing for a bachelorette to see if they could mail it earlier, the night before I needed is is when I got a response and they sent it fedex one day, the package got to my house while I was on the boat for the bachelorette. Would have been nice if they just did that a day earlier. Now the bathing suit is it’s sitting in my closet, unworn. $30 down the drain."
2856,Very happy with the customer service and product !
2857,"They are perfect, thank you!"
2858,Love the fit. Very comfortable
2859,Very happy with my purchase!
2860,True fit and was delivered on time!
2861,"Letters began to peel off after wearing the bathing suit for less than half a day, and not even going in the water!! Very disappointed. It was ordered for a bachelorette and in the pictures my bathing suits letters are hanging on by a thread. I definitely had higher expectations"
2862,Delivered quickly and great quality!
2863,Before purchasing make sure you review the color on the picture/icon. Do not go by the name. I ordered a Light Pink but the color of the suit is identical to the picture. So not L.Pink. Swimsuit Size Chart is true to the size.
2864,These swimsuits were beautiful and my sisters loved them as a great surprised. Only issue is there were very big on us. Wish I would of gotten smaller sizes.
2865,Arrived exactly as described! Thank you!
2866,"The first order I got was incorrect - said they couldn’t do multiple colors and then did, and didn’t even put color we had discussed. However, they kindly redid my order and sent the suit corrected. A couple things to note: the letters were not completely centered - off to one side a little, letters still look a little messed up in some places (I asked for this to be addressed from first suit too), and it is a white one-piece swimsuit with no liner in the bottom area, if you know what I mean. Sadly, I don’t think I would do this through this company again, though customer service and offer to correct was appreciated. It’s attention to detail and quality product that would keep me coming back. Thanks!"
2867,Arrived quickly and as described.
2868,"Ordered the product on feb 15. I had to email the company in order to get the product ship after waiting over three weeks. Tried to get a refund but they shipped the product after I sent three emails, ironically. The product came and it looks good. I would just be concerned about the long shipping wait."
2869,"I was very disappointed with this shop. I ordered swimsuits July 17. The shop did not reply for 1 week regarding rush shipping, I paid for it then never heard from the shop. The rush shipping date came and went (August 1). Ultimately I heard from the shop August 6, apparently ‘new employees made mistakes’ and they overnighted my item. Received my item on August 8, 1 week after I had wanted the items. Swimsuits are really cute, love the padding. Had some weird marks on them after getting wet/ drying. But most came out after hand washing.  I will say they refunded my rush shipping but I will never order from this shop again."
2870,"The swimsuit is cute and fits well. However, the letters were falling off when I received it. I messaged the company with frustrations regarding my order and have yet to hear back to resolve the issue."
2871,"I ordered this for a bachelorette party. According to the size chart I’m a medium but I sized up to large based on reviews. When I got and tried it on it was so short. Definitely could have used a XL just for length and I don’t have a long torso. Also, half of the letters were peeling off. I contacted the seller and they sent a response telling me to fix it with a towel and iron. When I told them I didn’t have an iron I asked if they could send me a new one in an XL and I would be happy to send the L back. They didn’t respond but sent me a new one but sent the same size L. When I received it once again half the letters are peeling off.  My friend ordered one too black with white letters and they sent her black with gold letters and the letters are peeling off of hers too."
2872,"ordered this bathing suit for my bachelorette party, good quality material, but unfortunately the sizing was not good, too tight for me, and since it was special ordered, I was unable to return/exchange for larger size, so it was a big waste of money for me. And I will now have to figure out a new solution.  Very disappointed. 

Also, lettering was already falling off as soon as I opened. So lettering would have probably fallen off completely once worn in water :/"
2873,"Never received my item. Messaged multiple times and received one response that said they would TRY to get it to me on time....which would be a month and a half after I ordered originally. Ordered with 6-8 other people who didn’t seem to have a problem, so not sure why I’m having such an issue. I personally would try to rush someone’s order who has been waiting a month and needs it by a certain date."
2874,"Unprofessional. My bridesmaids and I ordered these suits for my bachelorette trip. 4 of them ordered their suits a week before me, and they still have not received it, yet I have received mine. Suits were supposed to ship 2 weeks ago. The seller did not contact anyone telling them about a delay. Everyone tried to contact the seller, but got no response. The seller finally started answering once cases were opened against the shop. Don't order from here if you need something by a certain date. You most likely wont get it, or get a response."
2875,My daughter received so many complements on this suit on vacation.  It arrived the day before we left which was perfect and fit her incredibly well.  Young without being overly sexy but still not matronly.   We both loved it!
2876,"This swimsuit is beautiful. I recently lost quite a bit of weight. My reward for reaching my goal was to buy clothes for the first time in over a year. I chose this swimsuit. Pretty brave, huh? Well, it fulfilled all my expectations and looks great on me. It’s a great way to show off all my efforts!"
2877,such stunning and quality made bathers. thanks so much 😍
2878,"This suit is beautiful; the colors and artwork are stunning; this is a piece of art! If you're looking for a unique suit, then consider buying this one! The only reason I'm giving this suit 4-stars is because sadly, I have to return it as it doesn't fit me.

Truthfully, if I were less self conscious about my body, I would have kept this suit. The adjustable straps are brilliant. But, I found that the band around the legs was too tight and created an unattractive sausage effect. Also, the suit isn't full coverage on the bum, so I found it rode up my butt when I bent over. And, having a short torso, I couldn't do the style justice.   

In case it helps those of you reading this review, I bought a size Medium. I am 5'5"" tall, 34B chest, 137lbs, and typically wear a size 6/medium on the top and bottom."
2879,"I ordered two of these for my trip to Maui, and they are hands down the best swimsuits I’ve ever owned. They are flattering, unique, and extremely well made. I am getting so many compliments, I can’t wait to order more for next summer!"
2880,Gorgeous swimsuit! Fit is great. For reference 5’7” 150# 34DD purchased L.
2881,This is such a CUTE swimsuit! I tried it on and it fit PERFECTLY! I cannot wait to take it out for swim on my upcoming vacation! I may be back to Visual Mood Swim for another. ☺️💝
2882,This suit is so flattering and the quality is excellent! I was so excited to catch it on sale! It has a retro fit and look yet still modern ♥️
2883,Exactly as shown. Arrived super fast and was prettily packaged. Fits well and is very classy. Love it!
2884,"Love, love, love this swimsuit! Can't wait to wear it on my vacation."
2885,"Excellent! Thick fabrick with lining, looks and fits great! Lovely packaging. Will be glad to buy more items :)"
2886,This suit is beautiful and feels really high quality. The shop is quick with communication.
2887,"This swimsuit is absolutely adorable. A big plus is that it's made from nylon, which is hard to find in a reasonably priced suit. The colors look great both wet and dry!

In terms of sizing, a medium was great for my frame at 5'8"", but didn't really fit the girls (though I loved the padding). It fits very similar to a J.Crew suit, but the material and price are much better."
2888,Adorable and well-made
2889,"Amazing work of art!  Thanks for your helpful and fast communication, and for making something so beautiful and unique."
2890,"Very nice! Very comfortable stays where you want it too!
Thank you for a lovely bathing suit!"
2891,Beautiful and well made! I received so many compliments!
2892,"Very good one from design, colors and material."
2893,"Good quality. Pretty prints. I am 5'8"" and sadly, it was a little too short for me. Had to return."
2894,"I was excited when I found CreationsbySavannah! It was everything I'd been looking for...cute, stylish and modest swimwear! Savannah was quick and helpful with all my questions and even tailored the suit to my measurements. I was excited when it arrived in the mail...it's beautiful! I love the design/colors (purple dots fabric) and I can't wait to wear it this summer! 

You did a wonderful job, Savannah! :) I will definitely recommend you to anyone looking for modest swimwear."
2895,I was able to custom to my own measurements and fabric styles.  Very easy to communicate with.  The dress did not disappoint!  I love it!!
2896,Savannah does excellent work. This is my third suit made by her and I’m so grateful for her attention to detail and the ease of communication. ❤️
2897,"Fits perfect,  the material in above picture wasn't available (this would have made it even more perfect) so another was chosen. Very heavy duty, I can see it lasting a long time. And best of all custom fit!"
2898,"I am thrilled with this swim dress!  It is modest, well made and the fabric is gorgeous!  I love the empire waist and it fits perfectly!  Thanks again Savannah!  :)"
2899,Beautiful excellent quality swimsuits! Love them! Savannah was very easy and pleasant to work with... We will buy again in the future! Thanks
2900,"I love the swimsuit she made especially for me with my exact measurements. It is very well made and fits perfectly. So cute, modest and comfortable. Top-notch business!"
2901,Love it! I even got to customize colors!
2902,I love every suit I order from Savannah. I recommend her suits to everyone. ☺️
2903,Love it! The fabric is sturdy and thick and the fit is right. :)
2904,Beautiful & professional!! Absolutely love my new swimsuit!!!
2905,"I love this swimsuit! It fits well and has a nice stretchy material! Thank you so much, this is my favorite swimsuit yet! 😊"
2906,"This swimsuit is such a high quality and is gorgeous! 

I’m a tall girl (5’10”), with long legs, and high hips. The top of the bottom section doesn’t quite work with my high hips, so it doesn’t give as gorgeous a shape as it does in the model photographs. But I’ll happily wear it regardless!"
2907,It's a gorgeous teal. Doesn't it from the sequins.
2908,I absolutely LOVE this swim suit!!!! Can't wait to take it on my honeymoon in May!!
2909,Fits perfectly and it's super flattering!!! Thank you!!!
2910,Abbbbsolutely loved this bathing suit! Great customer service - i was worried it wouldn’t get here in time for my bachelorette but it arrived early! Will definitely be buying another in the future :)
2911,"Absolutely gorgeous, stunning, and beautiful! Her work is perfection! She is a kind and considerate seller . She goes above and beyond."
2912,It fits perfectly and is such great quality :) I've already recommended the shop to many people!
2913,"Beautiful suit and so unique!! You won’t look like ANYONE else at the pool or beach!! Perfect amount of sparkle too, very classy. Doesn’t look to “young” either and even though it’s a once picked it is still EXTREMELY sexy, while still being comfortable!"
2914,Amazing. I love it!
2915,So cute and so well made.  Can't wait to wear to my bachelorette!
2916,"Might not end up going on vacation this year, but can’t wait to wear this suit regardless!"
2917,"It is a beautiful suit, but the description says that the top will fit all, and it does not. Fits great everywhere except the boob area."
2918,Love my bathing suit! Wore this bathing suit in white for my wedding weekend and everyone loved it! Thank you for the good communication and fast shipping!
2919,"PERFECTION wrapped up in this season's hottest color!!! I can't express how much I LOOOOOOOVE this suit! The way it frames my front and hugs my boobs... it is SO flattering!! The way the back ties is SOOOOO much better than any other suit that ties.. it doesn't cut into my skin because of the way it's made and cut - it supports and looks cute because its not some rinky dinky string... it's thicker so its more flattering. On to the GENIUS ruffle design!! Like I said in my coral/leopard suit review, again, this hugs my boobs JUST right so they looks amazing! I feel so pretty in this suit.. with the way the ruffles glide down and the scrunch butt makes my booty look- I actually feel beautiful in this suit... I've never felt that way in any other suit!! No sheer cover up needed! The double string tie feature is what sets Lucy's suits apart from all the rest... Plenty of support without that cut in skin line I get from other tops. I have to praise the scrunch butt again... I will never be able to wear another type of bottom after these. No one should. I'm a scrunch butt nut. The material quality is the best I've felt in a swim suit... Lucy, wherever you get your fabrics from- it's amazing.. REALLy good quality. Her shipping was faster than stated so I was ecstatic... I can't WAIT to show off all of my beautiful suits as a bride in Hawaii.. Lucy- You've spoiled me as I can never accept other inferior quality bikinis. And I love it. Happy customer for life. THANK YOU SO MUCH for making me feel beautiful- esp. in a bikini!! XOXO"
2920,This fit perfectly! I messaged her more specific sizes and it fit perfectly and looks great. I am ordering another one now
2921,Great quality and awsome fit.  Love it!
2922,"I loved this swim suit top. It was perfect for celebrating the Fourth of July. It was so well made and the store was a dream to work with. I was debating between sizes and when I asked what they recommended they sent pictures of the top on someone, and were just overall extremely helpful."
2923,Such a super cute suit! Love the snug fit and beautiful colors. Can’t wait to order more from her!
2924,You're sure to be a star in this patriotic top! Thank you!
2925,Perfect! Beautiful & great material. I love it!!!
2926,"When you are a business owner, you accommodate for your mistakes. Wrong color, supposed to be stripes but got stars and they wouldn't refund. Don't have time to send back because I need something now for a video shoot. Refund was denied for my inconvenience. Took a long time to get to me anyway.

Annoying and Irritating experience especially because I messaged the owner about the specific item before purchasing..."
2927,I am in love with this! It is fitted perfectly for my body and it is exactly what I wanted. :)
2928,"reiterating what past reviewers have said...AMAZING! 

this was my first time purchasing a swimsuit online and I couldn't be more pleased. I contacted Breezie about adding a little more coverage to the front and back, and making the arm holes a little larger. she altered this suit to perfection.no joke. so in love with this purchase and will definitely buy more from this store. thank you <3<3<3

one thing to note! it takes some time for her to turn this around because they are hand made, so it's best to order a month in advance if you need it for an occasion. patience.it's well worth the wait!"
2929,"Such a cute suit, and it fits like a dream! I was nervous about ordering a one piece suit because I am very busty (36 D-34DD) but this suit is magic. Very supportive and flattering all over, and so comfortable and well made!I can't believe I waited so to order this suit, and I have already ordered more Stardust suits in different styles and colors because I was so impressed with the craft."
2930,"I love everything about this gorgeous swimsuit! The fabric is perfect, the fit is amazing, and the color is immpecable. I have never owned a one piece before and now I can't imagine wearing any other swimsuit. I was initially concerned I wouldn't fit into the swimsuit or it would show my....different bumps and curves on my body but I am so pleasantly surprised! This swimsuit is beautifully made and fits like a glove!! I can't imagine finding a better fitting swimsuit in any department store! Will most definitely be buying them again ❤️"
2931,SUCH an amazing swimsuit. This is the second one that I have purchased and won't be the last. It fits perfectly and I get so many compliments on it. Great communication with the seller - I really just can't say enough nice things! :)
2932,"I love this suit! Totally worth the wait. So comfy, great material, perfect color. Buy a suit from this girl, seriously, do it. xoxo"
2933,"Love my new swimsuit! Got the color and coverage custom done, and it is just what I hoped it would be! I'm 5'3"" and 117 lbs. The small fits perfectly."
2934,L O V E  IT! And so does my husband. Quality made and super comfortable to wear. The style flatters my body shape. Can I get one in every color?! LOL. I will definitely be purchasing from this seller again :0)
2935,"Obsessed. Had this made for me in white and customized the arm opening to be bigger-Perfection. The suit fits like a glove but does not cut me off anywhere either! I really like how supportive the material is too, very slimming. I've had the suit for only a couple weeks already received so many compliments. Very happy with this piece and will definitely be purchasing more suits from Breezie!"
2936,Absolutely in love with my new suit!
2937,"I loved this suit! The cut in the ""rear"" was very cheeky and attractive!shipping and service was great!
I am unfortunately so long in the torso it didn't quite fit.  So sad. But the shop and quality were great!"
2938,Simply amazing. Fits like a dream.
2939,"I requested a custom color for this swimsuit but was very anxious about ordering something off etsy (it was my first time). However, she was SO helpful and was quick to answer any questions I had. I don't think I've ever had better customer service. The swimsuit is absolutely perfect and fits like a glove. My only complaint is that my nips tend to look really noticeable if it gets cold, haha :) other than that I am so happy with the swimsuit and will definitely order from her again. Thank you!!"
2940,WOOO WOOO WOOO WOOO WOOO WOOO WOOO WOOO
2941,"Hi, the quality of the suit is excellent. The fabric is extra-thick (no see-through). Very, well made the fit is awesome. My girlfriend loved the fit, will soon be buying another one in a different color."
2942,PERFECT swimsuit. Comfortable & adorable & the shop was so easy to work with.
2943,This was perfect! I'm 6' tall and have a hard time finding one pieces that are long enough and fit my butt. Cannot recommend this more!
2944,Love this suit. Breezie anwsered my questions about sizing within minutes. The suit is very flattering. It's sexy but hides all my lumps and doesn't give me the dreaded camel toe that most one pieces do. Customer for life now. Thank you so much :)
2945,"I've been eyeing this one piece for a while and am so glad I decided to take the plunge so to speak. Fits perfectly, just the right amount of butt coverage!"
2946,Best bather ever- thank you!!
2947,"Beautifully made suit, such a lovely color! Not to mention INCREDIBLE customer service. Wonderful seller, I'll definitely be back."
2948,"I got my mama tried . Very happy, best communication. I will order some more"
2949,Love this suit! Adorable! Great seller; thank you!!!
2950,"Although it's a little snug, I feel sexy in this well made suit. ❤️"
2951,Love! So fast too! Thank you!
2952,Great communication from seller. She was quick with responses and very helpful with any issues I had. Appreciated the attentiveness and concern. Would buy from again.
2953,Beautiful color blue with a tan
2954,fits nicely and came super quickly upon request! happy
2955,Swimsuit was a bit off on the sizing but not something where I feel like I wouldn’t wear the swimsuit. I’ve ordered before and will do so again
2956,Absolutely perfect! Second order from Olga and her work is fantastic and of the best quality. I would be happy only purchasing competition bikinis from now on from her!
2957,I absolutely love this suit even in the little gold bag it came in. Handwork is very detailed to perfection stones are in perfect order and glued not falling off size fits amazing on my body. Will definitely be purchasing more suits from Olga. Highly recommended.
2958,Photo doesn't give it back  how beautiful it is ?? thank you!
2959,Stunning as always! Thanks for all your hard work! Till next time!
2960,"Hi

My Padded Halter Bikini Top Adjustable Back Straps For Extra Comfort  it feels great on me.   I Love The halter Bikini Top.   THANK YOU.   HAVE A GREAT DAY   SUKI KORMENDI   :  )"
2961,"My wife definitely turns heads when she wears this!  Order was processed and shipped quickly but took quite a while to arrive.  Company was friendly and responsive to communication.  Good quality for the price.  Fit is a bit on the small side, but I mean, it doesn't provide a lot of coverage by design... It's more than adjustable enough to make it work (just don't plan on staying covered if you bend down to pick something up).  She's only worn it out a couple of times so far, and received many compliments.  Happy overall."
2962,I really love this! It fits perfect!
2963,"Good support and coverage. By the photo, I thought it untied in the front  AND the back. It does not. It unties at the neck and the back , which helps adjust the fit. Good price.  Hard to find a good fit in a swim suit top, but this one definitely will work for my figure."
2964,Bought this for my daughter so no picture but very nice quality and fit perfect. She was thrilled.  Thank you!
2965,It was a little big I could’ve went down a size! It’s definitely cute but would’ve been a lot cuter if I didn’t look as big! 8/10 tho!
2966,Great item! Shipped quickly. Would highly recommend seller.
2967,"Looks exactly like pictures, really good quality"
2968,Its just super cute on me
2969,The fit is horrible and the cups are made from a cheap foam... would not recommend
2970,Very cheap material. Not happy
2971,"Really bummed thought a C would be less coverage more cleavage, and barely any push-up really disappointing cuz it’s cute"
2972,Runs small in cup size
2973,Seller is a lier and tried to say that she shipped the product out when USPS still after a week hadn't received the item.
2974,Tried to contact shop twice for a return but haven’t heard back.
2975,"Great fit and colour. Arranged courier delivery with Andy as I needed it quick. Posted Friday in Spain, arrived Monday in UAE. Thanks for the extra effort."
2976,"I was a little worried about buying a women's bathing suit online without being able to try it on, but I LOVE my bathing suit. It fits perfectly. It hugs all the right places. Looks great on. Very excited and will definitely shop here again."
2977,"Nice materials, flattering cut, and fast service."
2978,"LOVE THIS BIKINI, got it for an anniversary trip, hubby loved it too!! The seller is amazing, super quick to respond, sent it way ahead of schedule, could not be happier! I was even a little crazy, changed some things around on her last minute, and she responded so quickly and kindly. Will definitely buy more from this shop! Thank you!!"
2979,"There aren't enough stars to rate this shop, they are absolutely amazing!! I'm a bikini junkie cause I live at the pool and I ran across this shop and fell in love with every one they had! So I immediately ordered 3 ! There was one that absolutely adores but the color wasn't right for me so I emailed sweet treats and asked if it was possible to have it made in a different color and they responded right away and fulfilled my request 😄 the bikinis arrived much sooner than I expected especially for a custom order and when they got here they were even more than I expected!! They're absolutely beautiful and so well made they were to die for!!! I loved them so much I got on their site immediately and there I ran across their loungewear line which was obviously to die for as well and ordered two jumpsuits! Customer for life!!"
2980,"Bought this for my GF and the bottoms fit well, the top is a little tight and where the string in the top attaches to the main piece it ruffles which doesn't look the best."
2981,Love!! Love!!! Love!!! Its the cutest bikini ever!! It looks exactly like the picture and is very well made.
2982,Great.  Thank you! Angela Cabral
2983,I was uncertain about ordering a $100 custom bathing suit. But glad I did! Never had a suit fit so well!
2984,This is the second swimsuit that I have purchased from Harajuku. Love it!
2985,"thanks, i love it! i've never had a one piece that fit me this well. :)"
2986,perfect thank you so much
2987,Super cute top & fits true to size! I wear a 34C/32D and it fit me very well! Fast shipping!
2988,"Cheap fabric, shipping was fast, but not happy with the cut or material"
2989,"I really feel what you have designed is important. I mean, women's clothing is often designed to make us feel bad about our bodies. And it's amazing that we can grow a baby and birth a baby and nourish a baby with our wondrous bodies. I think more of our clothing should reflect that miracle and make doing that amazing work more fluid, more easy. Your swimsuits do that. I have always worked on my own body image and tried to help others with theirs. It shows up in my songwriting, storytelling, and in the music lessons and yoga I teach. It is just so pervasive an issue for so many people, especially girls and women. I really value what you're doing. I'm so thankful I found your swimsuits! -kristimartel.com"
2990,Love this suit. I'm 19 weeks pregnant and it fit perfect. The great part is I can still wear it post pregnancy. Love the versatility.
2991,"Once again, swoon! I got the same size (L for extra drapey styles) but the super popular green color. I was nervous - green can either be a hit or a miss with my complexion - but this is a really lovely emerald color!"
2992,"Great suit.  Multiple ways to style it especially on my pregnant belly.  A little surprised how big the large was, I am 7 months pregnant and still have a lot of slack left (maybe a little too much?). I have to tie a big knot...So, for you smaller pregnant ladies maybe something to consider. But either way very pretty!"
2993,This suit is so lovely. There is a learning curve though. I wish the seller would update the tutorial to show some of the styles that are photographed on her store. Until then trial and error but such a fun suit and excellent quality
2994,Creative idea and works great for me at 7 months pregnant.  Excellent customer service!  Thanks so much!
2995,I love the product. I unfortunately bought too big of a size but it is a wonderful suit anyway
2996,It got here so fast and is so soft and stretchy. Even had a personal hand written note in it! Definitely someone I will be buying from again. (:
2997,"Color, material and versatility... OMG just can't go wrong!"
2998,Beautiful color.  Cant wait to try it out.
2999,"The package was dispatched the same day as I ordered it. The colour is lovley, it's comfortable, versitile and funny. Definetly the best bathing suit I've ever owned"
3000,Very easy to follow compared to the other ones I’ve tried. I found a lot of great vendors I could possibly work with. Thanks again
3001,Legit And cheap websites. Thank you 😊
3002,This list is very good
3003,I was expecting phone numbers not links
3004,One of my all-time favorite anime and you fulfilled my look for my birthday. Material is awesome. Durable if handled as delicately as this piece is to me and looks great!!! I am so pleased. Responds quickly and I got it in no time. Right size and fit for me. I usually don’t leave reviews but I had to for all the compliments I received and I loved it myself. 😍
3005,"I ordered this, the Chun-li, and Ahri bathsuit, and this is honestly such amazing work! Will definitely order more in the future."
3006,Best bikini ever :) I even asked if she could add a few things and it turned out perfect!!! Highly recommend
3007,My girlfriend loves it!!!!! Fits perfectly. Thank you so much!!!
3008,"It looks just like the photo and fits perfectly....bathing suit doesnt move once you have it tied to your liking, it is also very comfortable! Wish i could give it more than 5 stars!"
3009,Love everything about it ♥️🙌🏻
3010,I'll edit my review once I'm back from vacation! I absolutely adore this. It fits perfectly.! Can't wait to be geeking out on my cruise.
3011,"I adore this swim suit and so does my husband, it is a bit cheekie. I did order based off of the chart but the bottom looks a bit small. But that's ok it's not too bad! Thanks! Fast ship highly reccomend."
3012,"I absolutely love this bikini.
The quality is great and it fit wonderfully.
Will definitely be buying something else from this shop!

3013,I love Everything about it.
3014,Such a cute Bikini!!! I love it so much!!!
3015,"Love the scrunch butt for the extra bit of cheek look! Was not sure about the material at first but came to around once I put it on :) Needs a little padding but nbd; emblem could be a bit clearer.
All in all love it :)"
3016,This is super silly and I love it
3017,Fits perfectly! Great quality as  well
3018,Fast shipping and I love my bathing suit!
3019,Great quality! Fit perfectly!
3020,Nicely made and cute but when they say no padding on the top they mean no padding. You can see the entire outline of everything. More lingerie than a bikini. I can't imagine wearing it in public. I figured it would be thicker fabric if it didn't have padding. Everything else is great though
3021,"I received my order yesterday and I'm very happy with it,it fits great and is very cute! I can't wait to wear it"
3022,Great buy! String could be stronger though
3023,"Good quality, nice fit and worth the price."
3024,My friend loved the bikini. But the XL top was smaller then she thought. Should have gotten XXL.
3025,Amazing seller! So helpful
3026,I love the screen printing and the cut of the top. The elastic ties feel looser compared to the rebelkini (idk?)
3027,"Super cute, comfortable, arrived quickly, will buy from again."
3028,"Very great product just wish the strings for the bottoms were not so long, when tied they hang down very low"
3029,"I adore this swimsuit!  It fits my body, and I am so thankful to have a swimsuit made specifically for my body type. :)"
3030,My daughter received both a two-piece and one-piece swim suit today and called me very excited with how they were packaged. The excitement continued as she opened them and tried them on. She said they fit perfectly and she was beyond pleased. She is going to enjoy wearing them on her Disney cruise in March. Thank you.
3031,Fits perfectly. Can't wait to wear it on my honeymoon.
3032,Very nice product.   Thank you.
3033,Came as shown in the picture! I wear a 32C and am 115 lbs. I got the Medium size and love them
3034,Very easy to cut to the desired shape! Prompt shipping as well.
3035,FahrenheitSwim is my go-to for swim essentials. Quick shipping as always.
3036,FahrenheitSwim is my go-to for swim essentials. Quick shipping as always.
3037,FahrenheitSwim is my go-to for swim essentials. Quick shipping as always.
3038,Thank you once again for an excellent product.  It fits perfectly!  I'm so thankful to find clothing that makes it possible to enjoy water sports with my family!
3039,This swim skirt was lovely and well made. I especially appreciate the obvious love for her work that this merchant shows.  She's a jewel!
3040,It was a perfect fit!  I love it!
3041,"Love this swim skirt!! The attention to detail is amazing, even my rush order was immaculately made. Will definitely be ordering again in different colors.  She is wonderful to work with to make sure it's customized just how you want it. You will not be disappointed!"
3042,Arrived very quickly and the suit looks and fits great!
3043,Great customer service.  Very friendly shop owner.
3044,"I absolutely love the set I ordered. She has the best customer service and was sooo helpful. I can’t wait to wear my set, thank you so much!"
3045,"The customer service was amazing and helped me get my size and was very sweet. They shipped super quickly and even inserted a really cute gift as well. The bikini fits perfectly, is so soft & more than I had ever hoped. I have received many compliments, I can’t wait to wear all summer!"
3046,This set is super cute! And it’s a lot cuter in person! I even bought a couple of more in different colors!
3047,"This shop is so fantastic!! This is the second of this bikini that I have bought just in a different color, and I couldn't be more pleased! I had issues with the bottoms being a little too loose, but when I contacted her she responded immediately and sent me a new & improved set of bottoms! I am so grateful and recommend this shop so highly!!"
3048,"Fits super well, sort of cheeky!"
3049,Amazing quality and color! Fit just right too💕
3050,These bottoms were absolutely perfect ! I am in love and received so many compliments on them ! They hold in all my wobbly bits ( mom of 2 kids) I will be buying more from here ! The quality is amazing...nice sticking and sturdy well made material ! All of my questions and concerns were answered ! Thank you ladies so much for an amazing piece !
3051,Won't be posting photos but I am SO happy with this product. They fit so nice and you can tell that a lot of care was put into them :) <3
3052,"Their were a few complications with the shipping, but over all I am pleased with the service, and the swimsuit its self. I'm definitely gonna buy from 
""Pita Pata Diva"" again."
3053,I am 5’11” 150 lbs and a large fit perfect!
3054,"5'5 128lb /32c, slightly big on straps, tried on my daughters small but the bust area was a little too snug for me so I would say the medium was a good fit.  If your small on top like an size a cup small would be perfect at the size above."
3055,Item too large and shop would not accept an exchange for smaller size
3056,I love this . The top came pretty quick and the seller is super nice . The quality is really great!  Thank you bstyle
3057,"I'm a 36DD, 5'9"" and a dress/pant size 10. I ordered an XL and it fits GREAT! 

Material is so soft. It's really flexible and like any bikini top that does not have underwire I'll need to be careful to avoid a wardrobe malfunction. No complaints and shipped super fast! Will be back for more! 

Can't wait to wear this to my friends Texas themed bachelorette! 

Thank you!"
3058,"Suuuuuper fast shipping!  Quality product.  I’m 5’7”, size 16, 36D and wearing an XL.  Fits well.  Will take practice positioning and tying but overall this is the perfect top and exactly what I’ve been searching for.  
Highly recommend this seller!! 
Seamless purchase."
3059,"This swimsuit top with its unique wrap around design really makes it fit perfectly; you can adjust to your comfort level. For large breasted women, I'd suggest messaging the seller to make the cups/coverage larger; but, I can make this work/it's not a deterrent. Fabric is super soft! 

Great communication with the shop owner. Lightning fast shipping, nicely packaged. Great experience."
3060,"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE 
quick and beautiful"
3061,Love this handcrafted top!  Fits well and is very flattering.
3062,"Item came as described and fit perfect, the item took awhile to actually ship out, but once shipped I received in a few days."
3063,Greart product and quick delivery!
3064,Not as high quality as I was hoping but it works.
3065,Not what I expected based upon photos at all.
3066,"Ashley was great in answering my many, many questions. She made sure my items arrived in time before I left for vacation. I loved both bikini bottoms, they are as shown in the pics and they are a perfect fit! (24 waist, 33 hips, 34.5 bum) Great material, great service, really pleased!"
3067,Fast shipping. Well made. Quite skimpy (narrow in front). But I like it. Perfect for a burlesque costume I’m making.
3068,"Ordered June 9th, shipped June 12, got to my doorsteps on June 14! And it was exactly how it's displayed! This was my first ever purchase on Etsy and it was wonderful. Was a little nervous at first but now I'm wishing I could have bought several more in different colors!"
3069,"I am 5'8 with a 23"" waist and 35"" hips and I ordered the extra small; it fits perfect! Fast shipping (I ordered expedited) and the quality is very nice, I can't wait to wear it to the pool or beach, I definitely recommend!!"
3070,"Just as pictured.. looked great on.. the straps do tend to stay together unless you pull them apart and stay still, but it's still cute nonetheless."
3071,"Overall all really love this bottom (the Elijah).  The fit and quality is amazing, better than VS swimwear, which I’ve been a huge fan of.  The Lg for perfect, I’m usually a size 28 in pants, and 130 lb for reference.  She does an amazing job and is super attentive."
3072,I adore this piece. It's extremely flattering and comfortable and arrived right when I was hoping it would. The quality of fabric and craftsmanship renders the price extremely reasonable. When I get another break in the budget I'll definitely be back!
3073,Absolutely love it! Shipped in about two days. True to the color you choose and the measurements you provide. Great quality. She's also great at responding immediately. Totally worth the money! I live by the beach so I will definitely make more purchases!
3074,"Came quickly, lovely as advertised 10/10 recommend the shop excellent customer service."
3075,Love the way it fits and love the coloring!
3076,Looks great on my body.  Thank you!
3077,awesome! the colors were spot on
3078,This bikini is SO sexy. My husband loves it. The fit is perfect. It arrived very fast and Ashley is great about responding with any questions I had. I will definitely order from her again. Thanks!
3079,love the fit! super sexy
3080,well made! fits like a dream
3081,Will be purchasing swimsuits from here again in the future
3082,"Very sexy , fits perfectly."
3083,Fit well and was well made.  I received it with no issues.
3084,Quick shipping and great customer service!
3085,"Absolutely Perfect!
Love the fit of these bottoms! She did a custom order for me so the band comes down a bit lower and hits right over my naval, exactly how I wanted. Even with the custom order these arrived at my door 4 days after payment! Best bottoms I own! I highly recommend ordering from Harajuku!"
3086,"I LOVE THESE! I'm kind of a weird size-- small waist, large behind. But she was able to mix a Medium band with the Large body, & it fits like a glove! Wonderful, custom-made , high quality garment."
3087,"These bottoms are lovely. They are very well made, great quality and are very flattering without looking matronly. They sit just at the right spot. Jo Ellen contacted me immediately after purchase to customize the fit. I will definitely order again."
3088,"This seller was great! quick response to fit questions. I'm 5'7,134, and fall 1/2 inch between M/L on the size chart-I ordered a large. They are flattering, and I feel like when I wear them they won't ride up:) My only reason for 4 stars is I think I fall between sizes b/c the leg openings fit but I think the hips/waist could be a bit smaller to hold everything in place. They're def still wearable and cute though!"
3089,Love my new swim bottoms! They fit perfect. Are comfortable (I like that the leg elastic isn't so tight it makes me have 4 butts 😉)  and high quality fabric. Shipped quickly. Worth every penny! I love the solid black b/c I can mix it with any of my tops.
3090,"I ordered a large, but it was too big so I contacted the shop owner immediately and exchanged it for a medium. It fits PERFECTLY! I love the black because I can wear it with any color bikini top. I am so pleased because we all know bathingsuit shopping can be a pain, but this was super easy and the shop owner is very professional. Definitely recommend this shop :)"
3091,"Best swimsuit bottom I've ever had.  Extremely well made, fits like a glove, and very flattering.  I can't wait to wear them to the beach!"
3092,"Let me start off by saying I am super picky, and had spent several months trying and failing at finding the perfect high waisted bottoms- These are literally THE perfect high waisted bottoms! Flattering, with full coverage and the perfect rise. Seller was so accommodating, and communicative. Highly recommend!"
3093,I love these high waisted bikini bottoms! They fit perfectly
3094,Wonderful! The bottom didn't fit quite right so I sent it back and I received it back very quickly and it fits wonderfully! Great shop! Easy and great customer service!!!!
3095,"Thank you for the great swim bottoms. I enjoyed wearing it, and can't normally say that about a swim suit! 

I ordered the high waisted bikini bottoms with a liner. The bottoms are great and the shop owner was a pleasure to work with. Highly recommend!"
3096,"Fits just right! I recommend JoEllen if you have a hard time with swimwear or an awkward shape, get it custom! Thank you!"
3097,Awesome product. Love it and am super happy! Speedy delivery.
3098,Perfect communication! Love the item! I recommend this seller.
3099,Fits absolutely perfectly! Very flattering
3100,Ravis 😀
3101,beautiful !!!!😍😍😍😍
3102,beautiful !!!!😍😍😍😍
3103,"Total schönes Top, sehr gute Qualität, top Verarbeitung!
Danke 💙🌺"
3104,I absolutely LOOOVE this piece!!! I have very long legs with large hips/butt and a tiny torso so the high leg option is much more flattering for me vs what is sold in stores. Not to mention it arrived fairly quick in the mail also!!! Thank you!!!
3105,Fit me perfectly and made well
3106,Love this swimwear. High quality and holds up well
3107,Fit is perfect! I've been looking for this style for ages. Would absolutely order again.
3108,"Just disappointed that the sizing was off. I ordered the same bottoms in the same size, but in brown. Fit perfectly fine, I decided to order another pair but in black. Ordered the same size as I did before and the black ones I got were way too small, and comparing them side to side are different ! I mean, I wore them because I have no other black bottoms. But my crack was almost out. Not fun haha 😂"
3109,"The sides seem uneven and the seams are somewhat rolled. It seems poorly made because the threads are already coming out a little. However, its a cute style and i’ll keep it. Not worth $35 though"
3110,"I’m 6’0 feet tall and 206 lbs. This xl custom bathing suit fit like a glove. Adashofchic did an amazing job with my custom birthday bathing suit. I will be ordering again.
They are quick responders and they ship custom orders out fast.
Thanks again for making my 45 bday a hit in Jamaica.

Happy satisfied customer!"
3111,These were great for my friend's 30th bday!!! Great quality!
3112,Great quality!! Im 6 feet tall and 160 pounds and this one was still not ling enough in the torso but the XL fits perfect!!
3113,"Love the suit! We bought matching ones for a bachelorette party in Vegas. Seller was so helpful with sizing! I am 5'9"" weighing 135 and bought a tall M. It fits, but I probably should have ordered a tall S. The  tall M is a little loose in the stomach, but better safe than sorry!"
3114,"Great quality! Very responsive and timely shipping. I have a long torso, smaller waist but bigger lower half and the large fit best for me. A little tight on the shoulders just because of my torso length but that's pretty normal. (5,7; 140lbs)"
3115,"I can’t write a great enough review for this shop! First off, she was so quick to respond to help me figure out the perfect size for me and answered all of my many questions. Shipping was extremely fast! And to top it all off, there was a slight problem with the font on my custom order. I sent her a message and she quickly responded once again. She found a new font that worked best for what I wanted and sent me another onsie on her!! And had it to my apt in 3 days! Now that is great customer service!  I can’t recommend this shop enough! I’m 5’4” and a curvy size 10. I went with the large tall suit and it was perfect! The quality of this suit is great!"
3116,"The size was hard to choose due to previous reviews. I am 5'6"", 125lbs, wide hips, small waist & chest. The seller was helpful and quick to respond. She was very willing to print the emblem I requested (additional $5). I chose the tall and plus size medium. I am having it altered because the top half was too big but the bottom fit perfectly. I probably could have gotten away with a regular fit large but not sure. The print came out really good. I would definately use this seller again."
3117,This was perfect! It fit true to size & it was exactly what I wanted. Shipping was very fast too! So excited to wear it in Mexico! Seller was very helpful and replied promptly.
3118,It turned out perfect.  Thank you!!
3119,The swimsuit fit great and it was of nice quality but unfortunately the letters peeled the first day of wearing the suit and that was really frustrating considering the price!
3120,Perfect swimsuit! Got the item very quickly and the seller was very responsive. Will shop here again!
3121,It’s ok.  Definitely not for “TALL” women.  It is very short in the torso.
3122,Great value swimsuit and fits well.  Many thanks
3123,Fast shipping. Item as described.
3124,"The suit Fit terribly, and fell off my shoulders to expose my chest. I messaged asking about the size twice and she had a short response telling me they have a detailed Sizing chart. I asked if ordering from the plus size/Big and tall would work for me, as I am short, but needed an extra large size. I figured she would have been able to answer my questions and give me her opinion, from past experiences of selling these bathing suits. It’s a weird cut swimsuit anyways. Smashes your chest while still being loose on the shoulders so it can easily slide off.  The lettering started to peel off some of the other girls suits after wearing them just once. We bought 6 of them for a
Wedding and we all agreed we would not be wearing them again. Disappointed in this as mine cost over $60."
3125,"I did not get the item I requested. When I contacted the shop they wanted me to pay for shipping back to them and then pay for shipping back to me. I'd already spent $100 on this and I hate it when I got it. The font was different, the color was wrong, and the suit was way to big (ordered off my measurements). 

Total waste of money and the girl was very rude and careless. Pissed."
3126,Literally my most favorite swimmy bottoms ever!!!! They are super flattering and I am officially obsessed. Love Love Love these!!!!
3127,Million stars I love this shit wore em out everyone but it!!!
3128,in love ! so happy with this it fit me like a glove perfect fit for my trip! thank you so much
3129,Super cute! Love the cut of the bottoms. Makes my butt look great! It's a little looser than I would like so next time I would probably size down since I like my bottoms extra tight
3130,"Can't try this on yet because I'm preggers but LOVE the material and cut. The material is very thick, and well made, I can tell it will hold well, and the cut is super cute (cheeky). The packaging was also super cute, felt like I received a present :) I will defo purchase from this vendor again."
3131,Perfect FIT!! Love it
3132,AMAZING. Best bottoms ever! cheeky enough but not too cheeky. LOVE THEM.
3133,I love these.  They are my favorite high-waisted bottoms!
3134,Initially ordered the wrong size. Priya Swimwear was very helpful in getting me the correct size and making the exchange quickly. the new size fits  perfectly and the quality of the swimsuit is great! I will definitely purchase from this seller again.
3135,I really love how these bottoms fit me and the material is very nice! This is the very first pair of bottoms that I have purchased where I don’t feel like they are going to fall off of me while I am swimming! The colors are beautiful and also the top that I purchased with it. I love everything about this store and I will for sure continue to buy from them!💙
3136,"Always enjoy working with Iffi ~ always high quality, beautiful work! I love my bathing suit."
3137,"I'm a US size 10 in women's, and ordered an XL.  They fit really well, with extra room around the lower butt so there isn't any awkward squishing going on.  Love these bottoms!"
3138,Comfortable AND sexy! I am so into these!! Thank you for making my new favorite swimsuits!!
3139,I love them!!! My new favorite
3140,"thank you very much, i love your Bikinis"
3141,"Me encanta, es perfecto! Gracias!"
3142,"Thanks a lot Iffat!
The bikini is great, love the material, and you were very helpful with my request.
Elli"
3143,"Beautiful product!  I received the sarongs within days of placing my order. All 4 were individually wrapped. Excellent price. Vibrant colors. I definitely will but from this shop, again."
3144,Thanks
3145,Great soft material like traditional wraps have.
3146,Great pattern. Thanks so much
3147,Great Product and Good Detail
3148,The seller was so sweet to go out of her way to accommodate my rush order.  Beautiful bathing suit that was perfect for my girls vacation in Grand Cayman!
3149,"This is the third suit I've ordered from Kooj!  Absolutely LOVE this style swimsuit!  Christy customized this suit to fit my measurements and my fabric of choice!!!  She's amazing at her craft!  I was really nervous about ordering a bathing suit that I couldn't try on, especially bc I NEVER seem to find a suit I feel comfortable in, but I'm so glad I took a chance and ordered from her!!!  Every suit she has made me, fits like a glove and is so comfortable!!!  Not to mention, I get so many compliments!  Definitely recommend!  I feel comfortable, yet stylish at the same time!  It's a win, win!!!  Don't hesitate if you're thinking about ordering from her!"
3150,"This item arrived quickly. It is very well made, with high quality fabric. I was impressed with the lining and overall quality. Most importantly, it functions well in ocean waves and pools!"
3151,OMG! This swimsuit is sooooo cute! I am usually very hesitant on purchasing swimwear but this swimsuit fits perfectly! I highly recommend this shop! Thank you!
3152,"What amazing quality!! It fits great and while it could've been a little bigger in the hips for comfort (I'm extremely hippy), it's the perfect length and has amazing coverage! The top part fits like a glove and it is overall extremely flattering. Love love love it!"
3153,This is the most comfortable bathing suit I've ever worn!  I got a lot of compliments on it too!  Definitely recommend!!!
3154,"Excellent construction and quality, amazing swimsuit perfectly made for my long torso, beautifully packaged.
Thank you Christy! You are a real artist.
The only problem was the shock of the custom duties and import VAT to Greece (more than 30 euros!!!), so unfortunately I cannot order a second one as I had in mind. Maybe a trip to the US in order to buy some swimsuits directly from Christy is a better idea ha ha! On the other hand, thanks God, I had bought this masterpiece on a 15% sale."
3155,"I have never in my life tried on a swimsuit and immediately felt amazing in it! It is beautifully made and it came really quickly in the mail as well. I am so, so pleased with my purchase. I'm never buying a bathing suit anywhere else!"
3156,"High quality, well made. I thought it seemed a bit tight at first but after wearing it I think it's perfect; I'm just not used to one piece suits. All the support comes from the suit (as it should) so I don't feel the need to tie the halter really tight to keep it up. The material is actually shinier than it appears which I don't mind. It's gorgeous and flattering."
3157,"Well sewn, good fitting, nice and fast replay when contacted. Can really recomend."
3158,Fits great and well made.  The fabric was a bit shinier than it appeared in the photos but still super cute.
3159,"Beautiful design and meticulous construction. It's really a perfect print that is unavailable anywhere else- most gingham suits are picnic table-ish but this one is just right- even better than the photos. Excellent customer service as well, highly recommended for international customers. Thanks so much!"
3160,Nice swimsuit!  Very well made and it looks great!
3161,Awesome. Very cute and flattering on my body.  No one else has anything like it.
3162,Perfect! Very flattering and made so well! I cannot wait to wear it this summer!
3163,OMGosh! I ordered two suits and they were custom made and arrived in just over a week. And they look amazing! Can't wait to wear them during the vacation in Mexico this weekend!
3164,"I ordered the neon yellow bottoms and had a scrunch added to the back and I absolutely love them! The bottoms aren't see-thru and were shipped much faster than etsy's expected date, I can't wait to wear them. :)"
3165,Olivia is the best! !!! Perfect fit great material
3166,Great quality and fit cheeky bikini bottom!
3167,"Love these! So comfortable!! Looks great! Gave me the exact measurements I asked for, got it before I went on vacation too! Thanks Savannah!!"
3168,Absolutely loved my swim skirts!!! Can't wait to show them off!!!   I just wish I would have went up to a small instead of a xsmall but that was my fault! I highly recommend her work. It was money well spent considering modest swim wear is hard to find now days!!! Will definitely purchase again!!!!!
3169,The skirt fits very well! I asked for mine to be made with the skirt and the leggings the same length and it turned out perfect!
3170,"I like the way Savannah made my skirt to flare a little, so it isn't too tight when sitting in a lounge chair. Great job, Savannah! Thanks again!"
3171,Beautiful!  I bought two for my daughters.  They are very flattering and great for swimming.  Both girls love them.  The swim bottoms are high quality and arrived sooner than expected. Thank you for a great product!
3172,Savannah is an amazing seamstress! Took the time to get exact measurements and also got our order to us before we left for vacation! Will totally be buying from her again in the future! Thank you!!
3173,"Love this swim skirt, Savannah made it to my measurements so it fits just perfect. Very high quality.  You will not be disappointed!"
3174,So cute!! This skirt and shorts set is absolutely perfect. It fits beautifully and feels great. The fabric is flows and sways and is very lightweight for a swimsuit fabric. Very well made. Will need to get one for maternity next year. :-) Thank you Savannah!
3175,Love it thank you ❤️
3176,Every swimsuit I've purchased has been top quality and these bottoms were no exception. I will continue to use Savannah for my swimsuit needs and recommend to others as well! :)
3177,Worked with me and super fast shipping
3178,Great swim skirt!! Savannah really worked me with with what I wanted. Thanks so much!!
3179,Love this!! Perfect coverage and so super comfy. I'm ordering another pair!
3180,Fits great and very well made! :)
3181,Awesome product. I would order these swim bottoms again.
3182,Wonderful seamstress and seller!  Thank you so much!
3183,Was made faster than stated and works great.
3184,"This was going to be my suit. I never used it, just tried it on. I expected Capri length (just past the knee) leggings, and a skir that came to rest just above the leggings and inch or two. That is not what I received. We discussed a lot of details because of the number of custom suits I ordered, and my desires were lost in the communication. I assumed responsibility but considering the issues I had with the top, I chose to return the suit entirely. I was very disappointed, as I had looked forward to having a comfortable suit to wear to the beach/pool with my family. The seller allowed me to return the bottoms (at my cost) stating it broke her own policy but she'd make an exception. She took 5% of the price I paid out of my refund. I have no comments to give about the fabric or it's quality, as I never used it."
3185,happy about getting my refund
3186,Absolutely perfect bikini. The seller made me a custom bikini within a couple days and it was delivered to me the same week I ordered it. The top didn't fit correctly so I sent it back and she fixed it with no problems or charges. She also fixed it within a couple days and sent it right back. I am now ordering two more because I'm am so happy with my bikini. She is great!! Thank you again
3187,Absolutely love the suit!
3188,Beautiful suit and fits perfectly since I am a curvy girl! Will certainly order again and post pics once I compete :)
3189,Great communication the whole experience. Confirmed everything prior to completing order- received order within days. Absolute best! Now I am show ready.
3190,Love my new swimsuit and it fits perfect!
3191,bikini top came a bit too big but ashley was kind enough to fix it for me and now it fits like a glove! fast shipping and can't wait to wear it in my bikini competition!😍 will definitely order from her again.
3192,Bikini was shipped out in fast time with a short notice ! Love every aspect of it ! Definitely an amazing  product for such a low price.Quality of the material is great! Seller does an amazing job. Will absolutely be purchasing more in the future
3193,Quick delivery and very nice. Measurements were sent. Top was perfect but pants a little too tight
3194,This fit perfectly! Shop is very responsive and the order was fulfilled and received quickly!!! I will definitely order here again!!!
3195,It shipped on time- the fit is perfect!
3196,Superb quality in bikinis. Great communication with Anthony the shop. And received it on time before my holiday! Will definitely be buying more in the future. Love love love!!
3197,"... very good service, great material and impeccable workmanship. 
I am looking forward to a nice and perfect bikini."
3198,"... very good service, great material and impeccable workmanship. 
I am looking forward to a nice and perfect bikini."
3199,"Really love this bathing suit! When buying a bathing suit, fit is so hard to get just right, but she tailored it to my measurements perfectly! I went an inch bigger on the butt area to make sure I had enough coverage, but I definitely didn't need to. (my mistake) but if I gain a bit I won't bulge out! lol

As someone that has shied away from buying a bathing suit for over 2 years I'm so happy that the first one I purchased makes me feel so comfortable and confident! I see myself buying many more in the future!

As far as actually make goes, it is ultra high waisted ( which I very much appreciate with my longer than life torso ) and the bandeau top is wide enough to not have any under/over boob happen."
3200,Super cute. Fits true to size
3201,"Color is as expected! And I love that you send your measurements so it takes some of the guess work out of buying a swimsuit online. There was an issue with FedEx and she was on top of it, I didn't have to handle anything :) Would definitely buy from here again."
3202,"I'm a size 4-6, closer to a 4. And the small a little tight in my opinion.. maybe it's just me so I'm not terribly upset about it. Also the color is a lighter tan than the picture. The quality of the swim suit is good but the stitching is poor... I was hoping for overall better quality and closer to the color."
3203,Perfectly made and cant wait to wear it!
3204,"I haven't received my bathing suit yet but Kerry was SO amazing to deal with it seriously warmed my heart! I asked for a custom made suit and she made me feel so good about myself and supported the fact that we all come in many fabulous shapes and sizes- she didn't even charge extra for this service which blew me away. Such wonderful customer service, I will be buying all my swimmies from here from now on and telling all my girlfriends here in Canada about Bikiniboo. Thanks again Kerry!"
3205,"Absolutely stunning, perfect fit! Very well constructed and designed beautifully. I can't wait to rock this glam little black number on the beach. 

For reference, I'm 5'3, 170 lbs, and I'm usually a size 12 in pants. The large fit like a dream."
3206,"Kerry is lovely to deal with! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask, she will help you. The swimsuit is so soft and comfortable, and the quality is amazing. I got size XS (hips 34'', waist 25,5'' height 5,5'') and it fits perfectly!  I will definitely purchase another one, when I have sufficient funds :) Thank you <3"
3207,It came asap and she was so sweet!! Im 5'10 and 170 so I got the tall medium and it fits like a dream! Now I'm off to the beach looking like a pinup model :)
3208,"Beautiful bathing suit!  Got it just in time for my trip to Cancun!  Fit perfectly.  Only had to adjust the top part quite a bit when swimming but only because I have no boobs!  Love this bathing suit and will likely buy another down the road!  Communication was great and she did everything to make sure I received it in time, and et the piece I liked best!  Thanks!!!"
3209,I love this suit! So flattering and comfortable.  Kerry is amazing to work with.  She was super responsive to questions and concerns I had.
3210,"This bathing suit shipped much faster than i expected. I am 5'7"" 140 lbs with a very small chest, small waist, but large hips. I got size medium and it fits perfectly! Very,  very flattering and well made."
3211,"I am so HAPPY! This swimsuit is gorgeous - - and it looks incredible on my curvy figure! Do not hesitate on this one, ladies. As soon as I can budget another one, I'm going to get a fun print. I chose black to start with because I had no idea how it would look on my curves (and I'm very glad to have it as my new staple for this summer) but this cut is SO flattering, I've gotta have more! The fabric is perfect!! Breathable but not at all see-through, not too heavy or too thick. Oh I could just go on forever...Extremely happy 😍 I'm 5'3"", 160lbs and I bought a Large. It fits perfectly. Thank you!"
3212,"So well-made! Fits like a dream. Slinky and sexy. Purchased a large, could have gotten away with a medium, for those interested in sizing accuracy. Ties perfect length to secure in small bow behind neck. Shipped quickly. Can't wait to show off at the beach this summer! Thank you, bikiniboo!"
3213,"I really like this swimsuit, the fabric is high quality and it is clearly well made. Overall the suit has a really flattering cut and I feel so great in it. There are so many cute designs I will definitely be buying a two piece from here in the future as well! I would definitely recommend the shop, Kerry is wonderful and so so helpful if you have questions. 

The only bad thing about the suit is that I'm a C cup and it doesn't provide great coverage, I'm going to buy waterproof tape to make sure it stays in place while I'm out on the beach. But I'm still keeping it."
3214,"I bought this suit hoping to escape the stigma of the typical awful mom-swimsuit...and it did not disappoint! My boyfriend almost fell over when he saw it (for real!), and I received tons of compliments when I wore it to a waterpark. It's sexy and fun and super wearable. I want one in every color!"
3215,"I wear 38 DD so my boobs like to fly out so I have to watch.. But overall, it fits perfectly and I absolutely love it!! 
I bought an XL and I'm 5'9 and 170lbs"
3216,"Amazing, this is the best bathing suit I've ever owned. The material is top quality and its comfortable as hell. I need doubled sided swim tape because I am a larger chested individual, but have received many compliments wearing it around the beach and a few pool parties."
3217,"My bathingsuit looks amazing! I was worried that my boobs might show, since I do not have a big enough cupsize to naturally hold the fabric in place, but Kerry told me she could add straps on the front and back to ensure save boobies! It still looks great, believe me! Also, Kerry is a very lovely and enthusiastic person, which made the experience of ordering quite amazing! I will have an amazing summer wearing this."
3218,"Kerry is the best! I received my first suit and it didn't fit quite as I hoped, so she speedily exchanged it for a custom suit, which I love! The material feels super nice, and I can't wait to rock this at the pool all summer. Great communication from Kerry, she is awesome 😀"
3219,This bathing suit is conservative yet sexy!!! The material is unique and extremely comfortable. I usually purchase a large but followed the shops size chart and purchased a medium and it fits perfectly! Definitely will purchase more from this shop!!
3220,Thanks so much!!! Finally came!! I'm working with a large bum and a small waist and this fits great!! Suns out bums out!!
3221,"WOW! I am beyond pleased with the suit. It fits exactly like I wanted it to and it's super flattering. 
I was concerned what my boobs would do, but the construction is so good, they actually stay put!
For reference, I'm 5'3 and a size 10 usually and the Medium fits perfectly.
I want one in every colour!"
3222,The suit is stunning in my beautiful wife. I love the retro high waist.
3223,"It came very quickly, I wasn't expecting it. I love it and it will be a summer staple! Thank you!"
3224,"The best swimsuit - I already choose the third one, and also the best seller, which helps me with delivery on time. Kerry, thank you so much and I will recommend you everywhere."
3225,This swimsuit arrived quickly and the fabric is just amazing! I was worried about it being too tight but the fabric she uses is so soft and flexible without compromising coverage. Love it!
3226,"In love, already ordered another!!! Beautifully made, so easy to wear.  I am not one for halter top bathing suits because the way the halter pulls and ties around my neck, it causes headaches for me.  However, because the ties come up from the waist, not the outer sides of the breasts, it doesn't pull tight around the neck. You can tie the halter as tight as you wish though. Very comfortable around the buttocks, nice coverage in front and my breasts don't get smooshed. So flattering on. Love love love. Thank you!"
3227,I love this bathing suit
3228,"LOVE this suit, it fits beautifully. If you consider buying, definitely go by her size chart. Awesome communication from seller! Will order again."
3229,Incredibly pleased with the overall quality and craftsmanship of this suit. Ordered the wrong size and she was beyond helpful with getting me exactly what I needed. Couldn't be happier!
3230,My chest and bottom don't quite fit the medium but some more toning and it will look great!
3231,This swimsuit is gorgeous. Kerry was also incredible - she responded to my message almost instantly and ensured I received my suit in time for my holiday. I will be ordering again. xx
3232,"Beautiful swim suit. It's the perfect combination of sexy and modest. I was worried about it not providing enough coverage on the top, but once it's wet, it stays on pretty well. I would argue to say that it provides as much security in the water as any bikini top. 

The stitching is cute and very detailed. All around a very well-made, flattering one piece swim suit. I will definitely be buying again!"
3233,"Hands. Down. The. Best. Swim. Ever.
Kerry does amazing work. Both swimsuits I bought were perfection! The black was so soft and the plum peony is a perfect color. I am 5'5"", with a very long torso, so next time I might try the longer ones!"
3234,Absolutely beautiful and classic!  Beautiful top notch work! She is a kind and considerate seller that goes above and beyond! I'll be back again and again!
3235,"Perfect fit, I love it!"
3236,Love this so much
3237,"Not only was the quality of this swimsuit outstanding, Kerry's customer service was brilliant. She responded to me really quickly to answer my questions, got excited about how I would be styling her products and had it sent to me in record time (I'm an international customer). This is now my staple source of swimwear. Cannot get enough."
3238,This swimsuit is so fabulous. I was hesitant from ordering from overseas (I live in Seattle) because I knew if it didn't fit or I didn't like it a return would be a hassle. I'm so glad I ordered though. The fabric is great- so soft and not too thin but not too thick either. This cut is so flattering. I felt like a celebrity on vacation. Highly recommend.
3239,"I really wanted this to look good on me but it just looks frumpy. The back just goes straight across and it just makes my backside look large and flat. The front is a pretty cut but def wear pasties if you're concerned about a wardrobe malfunction. Good quality but the fit isn't right for me. For reference I am 5'10"" and 170 and  curvy"
3240,"Amazing swimsuit! My size 34c's stay in this while swimming and splashing, no problem. A truly body affirming and complimentary suit, couldn't be happier."
3241,"When I got this bathing suit, it was exactly what I was hoping for. the material is very soft and the suit overall is very very well made. I was concerned about the top being a bit revealing or that it wouldn't stay in place but it does nicely. I saw before that a few people suggested using garment tape to get it to stay in place but I haven't had any issues and I am a B cup. The seller was amazing to work with and very accommodating."
3242,"Beautiful! Perfectly made, very flattering and the seller is so sweet!"
3243,I haven't purchased a one piece bathing suit since I was little because I have THE longest torso and most don't even come close to fitting! This however fits excellent! I am so beyond excited to have found bikiniboo and would highly recommend! I'm actually in the process of ordering another suit now :)
3244,"I've never felt so good in a swimsuit! I honestly can't wait to wear it this summer. The product fits beautifully and is very soft and the delivery was fast and uncomplicated.
I'm completely in love with it. Thank you!"
3245,Love this swimsuit!! Very happy with my purchase
3246,So perfect for my honeymoon in October. Sexy and still covers all my problem areas. Large fits perfect. Thanks SOO much for your beautiful creations. Will definitely be ordering more in the future!!
3247,Absolutely love (per usual)! I feel like I can either let this suit be sexy or modest...depending on how I lay the top. I can't wait to wear it! Thanks so much again!
3248,Love it ❤️ perfect fit & nice fabric
3249,I really appreciate the extra length with the tall-option. It was easy to check if the suit would fit me and the fit is just right. The material feels nice and the garment is well made. Would recommend!
3250,Love it! It fits great!!
3251,This is a well-made suit. Love it!
3252,Really good quality fabric and super fun!
3253,Love it super cute and comfy
3254,"Loved it!! It held well, there were no nip slips or malfunctions and I got compliments. I'm very happy with it and the shop's flexibility and excellent customer service."
3255,the fabric is great.  it keeps me in.
3256,"Lovely service.

Cozzy just a little too big on arrival, so I returned it and swapped for a smaller size (I’m a 16, bought XL, swapped for L, much better).

Lovely friendly help throughout."
3257,I love this bathing suit so much 😍 it's beyond comfortable and it looks great. I plan on ordering more suits soon. Thank you for your work and fast delivery!
3258,J'ai reçu cet article très rapidement il est vraiment bien taillé. Juste parfait merci !
3259,very sexy and nice!!! i love it!
3260,I ordered the black and blue and white striped and love both! Can't wait to wear them to the pool!
3261,"Great swimsuit, perfect fit, very flattering design. Shipped quickly"
3262,Very sexy. A little more revealing than I planned but definitely going to save for a sexy pool party!
3263,"Fits as described, super flattering, and a nice thick material. Would order again!"
3264,"Very cute and well made, exactly what I was looking for and expecting to receive !"
3265,"beautiful suit, very well made."
3266,Love the fit; can't wait for an excuse to wear it!
3267,ill fitting but cute- not good for bigger chests
3268,"IN. LOVE. Everything I had dreamed up in my head while waiting for it to arrive became not only reality but exceeded my dream suit expectation. The seller was SO great with my annoying back and forth trying to explain how I wanted it to fit/look/etc. She is just so polite, professional, and I am so happy to have spent my money here. Customer service is BEYOND excellent and the suit is a beyond perfectly crafted piece. 
Shipping was SO quick.
I'm elated.
Thank you so much Katerine❤️"
3269,"item as described, sooo amazing I love it so much, great communication as well :) thank you"
3270,"Fits perfectly, quick delivery and good quality! It even came with a surprise, thank you!"
3271,Excellent seller! Prompt shipping and great communication. I absolutely love the bathing suit. The print is amazing and the quality is wonderful!
3272,Great service!
3273,"I actually ordered this a while back, and it even came earlier than expected. (With a cute little extra gift, thank you!) But I held off on wearing the whole cosplay until a convention last weekend. So now I can finally do a proper review on it! ^^

This is such a cute design, and what I received did not disappoint! It's overall flattering to my body and is comfortable and in good quality. Daren even gave a couple tips in how to properly wash them so that the bikini remains in great condition. I will say, however, that while the bunny detail that is on the front of the bikini is very cute, its ears came out quite pointy and can poke if you're not too careful! But despite that super tiny flaw, I still love the bikini, and it's perfect for both a cosplay and a regular beach outfit! <3"
3274,This arrived so fast & Im so obsessed. The quality is great & it was packaged really cute & safely. Ill def be returning for the Mercy piece soon!
3275,"Overall, I couldn't be happier with the swimsuit! It's very well-made and sturdy, has adorable details and the colours are even cuter in person. The customer service was above and beyond as well; very attentive and pleasant. Watch yourself on those ears, though, they're a bit sharp!"
3276,"Arrived in two months which was great for Australian mail! The top was perfect but I had to remove the elastic in the bottoms so it fit comfortably. Not that big of a deal,  and overall it was very well made! Shop owner was responsive too."
3277,"Amazing quality and attention to detail, it fits like a dream. Would deffo recomend ordering :)"
3278,"Gorgeous and super sexy. I loved the small. I'm 5""2 and medium built. It was a comfy and sexy suit."
3279,"It is hard to find a good bride bathing suit in white that isn't see through, and that is good quality, and covers you up.  This one exceeds my expectations!"
3280,"Such a cute idea and loved what the shop designed...but the white was super see through and my sister Inlaw can’t wear it....so $40 something down the drain ☹️
But seriously the thought is super cute...her work is amazing just maybe don’t order the white swimsuit 🤷🏼‍♀️"
3281,My friend absolutely loved the swimsuit that I️ sent her! The sizing was spot on.
3282,These suits have a very short torso and be sure to read the return policy the owner will not be willing to work with you if the item does not fit.
3283,Arrived in time and looks as described.   Beautiful design.   Material is a little thinner than I'd like but I know it's meant for the beach.  My kids have been stealing my sarongs which I use in the car or plane as a light blanket and shawl.  Now they'll get their own for Christmas with very cool prints!
3284,"Beautiful sarong
Great customer service 
5/5"
3285,The shipping was quick and product is amazing!
3286,Beautiful prints and I appreciated the cute extra gifts and fast shipping. Can’t wait to wear my pareo in Tahitian class. Mahalo
3287,"Great product, would buy again."
3288,I'm in love with this top! I wanted something cute and comfy to wear in the tub for my Homebirth. I'm pretty large chested so was worried about the fit but I followed the instructions and gave her my measurements and it fits perfectly! 💗
3289,"This swim bra is SOOO comfortable. I will be ordering more simply because honestly I HATE bras, but found this one crazy comfy! Who cares if I turn them into my everyday nursing bra? Who is gonna know??? Seriously, most comfy bra ever. Good thing too since I bought it to labor in."
3290,"bought a bra for birthing in (water birth) and for nursing and so far it has been great, very comfy (I am very large-chested) and super cute!"
3291,Amazing! I like these even better than the regular bras because the material has more stretch and structure and doesn't lose shape. Lined with the soft grey lining it's perfect!
3292,"The top is super cute but fits weird. It’s way to high and not easy to pull down to feed, like the straps are not long enough or something. I really was hoping to love it. Seller was great though and it shipped quickly."
3293,Perfect fit!! Beauitful quality. Perfect for waterbirth/swimming/nursing
3294,Exactly what I was looking for! Fits well. Made well. Super cute pattern. Just ordered a second one! Shipped on time.
3295,Love it! So easy to nurse in.. And looks amazing on!
3296,I can’t say enough about this bra. I could cry because it’s taken me so long to finally find a good bra. If you have larger boob or sagging you need this bra!!!!
3297,Love it! fits perfectly & very well made! recommended to my sister who is having a home water birth as well!
3298,"It's definitely comfortable...only thing I wish it had was pads. I definitely can't wear this in public (for the two years or so that I'll be breastfeeding) because there's zero padding.  These nursing nipples don't hide on their own lol anyways, it'll be perfect for when I deliver the baby in the birthing pool and will also be good for at home wear."
3299,Perfect fit. Comfortable and crunchy. Great nursing bra that’s so stylish
3300,"- very comfortable
- fits perfectly
- cool print
- shipped right on time

thank you!"
3301,Perfect fit! This will be very useful on the beach this summer. Thank you!
3302,"Sizing was WAY off. The shoulder strap part was not long enough, when I put it on it did not stretch far enough. The tension was so much that I cannot wear the item. I messaged seller 23 days ago inquiring about possible solutions, I have had no response."
3303,"Katie seems like such a nice person, thanks for the shipping the item so quickly! the top is so soft and fits perfectly, it's just so nice to have something unique and handmade :) I can't wait to wear it!"
3304,Love IT !
3305,"I received my Bat-kini yesterday and it's amazing. Lisa worked with me on the straps because I am a little too big for spaghetti straps. It was awesome communication before the purchase and during. I will be buying Harley Quinn, and the Imperial one for myself next!"
3306,"Excellent! Lisa was great to work with designing a custom bikini for my girlfriend. Her exact words ""THIS IS THE BEST BIKINI I HAVE EVERY HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!"" super comfortable, perfect fit, quality material and workmanship. Buy one! You won't be disappointed!"
3307,adorable
3308,You did an amazing job!!! I am looking to order more from you soon!
3309,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! And so does the boyfriend. This is perfect for our cruise next month!!!
3310,"This seller is fantastic. She responds quickly to my questions, customized my bikini exactly as I wanted it, and goes to great length to resolve any issue. So, CS is awesome! And, not to mention that the bikini fits perfectly and is HOT! I would highly recommend this seller and hope myself to buy again."
3311,"shipped really fast, it's really cute and fits perfectly"
3312,Looks amazing!! Great quality and excellent customer service!!
3313,shipping was on time and the bikini fits perfectly thank you so much
3314,Looks amazing and such great work!
3315,"Fit my wife perfectly, and she loved it.  Thanks again!"
3316,Looks terrific and shipped quickly to meet a deadline.  Thanks so much!
3317,Super cute! Great quality item
3318,"Très bonne qualité, bonne coupe.
Délais de livraison un peu long."
3319,"Bottoms are great, top doesn't have any structure. Not a top I'd wear while being active, great for sitting by the pool/beach. 
Good quality, price and shipping was quick!"
3320,"Order was fulfilled very quickly. The yellow is much brighter than pictured, but it still looks fine. A minor complaint on an otherwise perfect order."
3321,Took a month to ship
3322,"This item shipped very quickly! I was worried about this bikini fitting well since I ordered a large and I wear a 38D/DD depending. The bottoms fit well at a Large (I purchased high waisted) and my hip measurement is 41”. I will say, I was too scared to tie the top tight on the first try and the straps would not stay on. The hole for your arm is a little on the snug side so if you have long shoulders be aware of that. I also hardly get any coverage if I wear the top tied in the back, definitely could not do much movement if I wore it that way. Love the print and the flexibility, the fabric feels like it will hold up well. The bottoms are perfect in the larger. Iwould love to try a one piece next from this brand. TLDR: not ideal for busty folx. Fast shipping, good quality."
3323,Bathing suit fit perfectly and was absolutely gorgeous!
3324,"Excellent quality, looks just like pictured. The fabric feels nice and looks great, the packaging is also thoughtful and pretty. I’m very happy with it! 

Re sizing , in case it’s helpful to  anyone else: By the measurements, I was a M in the top and between S/M in the bottom; I went with M in both and it fits fine but a little roomy so I think I could’ve sized down"
3325,"Love this.
Fabric is good and craftsmanship is great."
3326,It's everything it's advertised as :)
3327,Gorgeous and perfect the small top fits and I am a 33B.  The xs bottom fits and I’m a 25 in waist and 5ft 1.5. It arrived really fast too!
3328,This bikini is the best bathing suit I have ever put on!!! It fits perfectly and I feel so beautiful in it! Thank you so much Suzanna!!!
3329,"Suzanne is so great to work with. Great quality, such a beautiful & flattering suit. Thank you!"
3330,This swimsuit is beautiful! The fit is right on and definitely the best suit I've ever had.  For sure my favorite! Thank you so much -
3331,"Love,love,love the suit! Thanks so much!"
3332,Great communication and such a lovely purchase! Fits beautifully and can't wait to wear it!
3333,Loved it! fits perfectly. Thank you!
3334,"Amazing quality, sizing and speedy postage. So happy. Thank you"
3335,"Arrived quickly , Nicely made. Top wasn't as big as I though. So be sure to give you cup size before purchasing to make sure it will fit"
3336,Amazing quality and fits really well 😊
3337,I like very much this swimsuit
3338,This is a soft and vivid material. Very beautiful and i love it. I received my items in a very timely manner. It was a pleasure doing business with the company and the conflict resolution was quick and without problems. Will do business again.
3339,Best bikini I've ever had! Love that is in un padded so it dries fast.
3340,The cup size of the bikini top was too small. I bought the same size in the costume and it fitted perfectly 😔
3341,It was the perfect suit for my bachelorette party in Puerto Vallarta!
3342,I am 125lbs and have an athletic figure. I ordered a medium and it fit perfect! Loved it! Super cute! I got so many compliments!
3343,Bathing suit came just as expected and is perfect for my warm bachelorette party :)
3344,"love it! super cute and great quality

Edited: just notice that the back of this suit is not lined.  That’s fine...except the white is really see through...when wet it’s going to be like I’m naked back there.  Even why dry you can clearly see my butt. Cute, but poor design."
3345,Awesome!
3346,Bought this for my sister and it fit her perfectly! Came much quicker than I expected.
3347,"I love how this suit looks on me, but unfortunately it is totally see through when wet. I should have seen that coming. I will be wearing it with jeans for my bachelorette party, though."
3348,"The letters look great, although the color is super see through although when I asked they denied. But I bought nipple covers in hopes of being able to wear this since you can’t return or exchange 🤞🏼"
3349,It was smaller than expected.
3350,I am late on leaving a review but I received my new swimsuit earlier this week and I am in love.  Ashley was very helpful and responded to my questions quickly.  She completely customized the suit just the way I wanted it.  The material is good quality and  the fit is true to size.  I would say that I should have possibly went a size up on my bottoms because it isn't to stretchy but the fit is still perfect.  I am beyond satisfied with my new bathing suit and cannot wait to wear it to my weekend trip in Vegas.  Thank you Ashley xoxo
3351,I order on Monday and Friday was here the shipping was very fast  I love it and she always answer all my questions about the product super fast love itttttt
3352,This bikini worked out perfect for my trip to Jamaica. I'll be going to Mexico in four months so I'm ordering a different color for that trip 😃👙
3353,these were so cute and comfy! I’m 5’9 about 155 pounds and got a size large set and it. is. perfect! Ordered and received in about THREE DAYS! Can’t wait to wear this set on my anniversary trip in Mexico!
3354,"Ashley is fabulous! She was very responsive and shipped quickly. While I was nervous to wear a thong suit in public, once I tried this suit on I was totally ready to rock it on the beach. Great quality and very flattering on my curves. I'll shop here again and highly recommend the shop."
3355,"This is my most favorite bikini I've ever had. It is beautifully made, lined on both top and bottom. Lace details perfectly complement the rest of the bikini. Never received as many compliments on a suit as I have with this one. Thank you!"
3356,"This item was for my friend that is a dancer. She finds the item great quality and has never seen anything like this before. The outfit fits tight and the thong is greatt its bathing suit lined. Shapes her butt perfectly. She's 130 pound 5""7. Great build and fits her perfect. The item had tracking and got here on time as promised"
3357,Love love this suit! The Bottoms fit beautifully and don't cut in! Already ordered a second.
3358,This bikini is awesome! I will be buying many more. Couldn't be happier!!! Thank you!
3359,The swimsuit fits my curves perfectly. I got alot of compliments. Im glad that i get a variety of choices & colors. Thank u! i'm looking forward to seeing more. I will definetly be ordering more in near future.
3360,Love the color. Perfect fit thank you
3361,So well made great quality!!!
3362,Item as described and shipped quickly. Very happy!
3363,I did not receive this yet. I asked for the tracking Number but no have answer
3364,Super cute! Got so many compliments
3365,I love it. It's so cute.
3366,Great quality
3367,"So pretty, very good quality and fast shipping:)"
3368,Nothing like photo. Poor quality. Tearing in places and the blue is a lot darker than picture. There are baby strings hanging on the back
3369,"The colors were not anywhere near as bright as the picture and the item reeked of cigarettes when it arrived so badly that I had to wash it twice before I could wear it, fading the color even further."
3370,They fit awesome and feel awesome!!! I have already ordered 2 more. I would love to find a venue I could wear these and it be considered normal!!
3371,"It's cute and effective, though I'm not convinced on the durability as it's already starting to develop tears and I've only worn them once."
3372,"The package came early which is great, so I tried them on and they fit a little tighter than I thought may need to get the next size up. Not sure yet. Super cute though!"
3373,Absolutely love these!! Great fit and feel! Fast delivery. Definitely a great place to buy from!!
3374,"Great quality, quick shipping. We followed sizing guidelines and the fit was good. The product doesn’t change the silhouette much without tucking so people who are too small to tuck will need something extra."
3375,"Looks exactly like the picture. I’m 190 pounds and 5’4, ordered a large and it fit perfect. Diamonds on it are cute and good quality. Will be purchasing again in a different color."
3376,SUPER CALI FRAGILISTIC EXPIALI DOCIOUS
3377,The quality & fit are great !!!
3378,very comfortable ..made well..the gold is a little bright
3379,It is a beautiful wrap and I’m so glad I purchased it! Shipping was perfect. I hope Sue will be inspired to make more plus size sarongs in beautiful ocean colors (my fav color is blue Sue!) as I will definitely purchase again!
3380,"I am absolutely in love with this! Fits like a dream, both as a skirt and as a dress, and absolutely gorgeous!"
3381,"Beautiful piece. I’m a 26-28 U. S. and this fits perfectly with an elegant fall in the front. 
More colors!!!! Please."
3382,"Arrived in timely fashion.  Exactly as described.  Lots of fabric,  pretty design."
3383,Great quality fabric. Going to purchase two more soon . Thank you.
3384,Perfect fit! Super stretchy and comfortable. I’m 5’3 and a size 4-6 and I got a medium
3385,Absolutely love this suit! Bought two for our trip to the Dominican Republic..they were perfect!
3386,I love the thickness of the material and the quality is superb. I can't wait to wear it on my beach trip. I absolutely love it!!!!!
3387,"Absolutely love all the colours I bought !! Definitely recommend these thing bikini bottoms!! Perfect fit! 
Thank you"
3388,"I was just looking for bikini bottoms and these were the perfect style, I was worried they wouldn't fit well as I find it hard with my body shape, but they fit perfectly!! I'm from the UK and the delivery was also great! As Soon as I got these I ordered them in a different colour!"
3389,Perfect fit!!
3390,Seriously so cute i love them
3391,Fabric is amazing. Exceeded my expectations! I was concerned with my tummy tuck scar but it is beyond perfect! And hubby loves it! Will be purchasing the blue set asap! Super quick shipping.
3392,Love the material perfect fit soft stretchy and perfectly hugged my booty :) thank you ! Will buy again soon

3396,Exactly what I wanted!! I cannot wait to go on vacation and wear it. I think I may need to order more colors! Awesome quality and fast shipping.
3397,She really works with you and the bikini looks great. Fits to size
3398,Love love love. Buy it :)
3399,Was on time! And looked/ fitted perfectly
3400,Very sexy
3401,Beautiful bathing suit. I wear a size 27/28 but the Medium was a little too big on me and I should have gotten a small. Some of the stitching on the back of the suit is messed up but overall not too noticeable. Seller was wonderful in helping me receive my order in time for vacation and that was rad. Would definitely order again in the future but would be more careful and take custom measurements to ensure proper fit
3402,"Non ho ancora ricevuto l’articolo e il negozio non mi fa più sapere lo stato della spedizione
Voglio richiedere l’immediato rimborso di quanto versato per questo singolo articolo"
3403,"very great material, love it"
3404,Great quality and the turnaround was really fast. Can't wait to order again!
3405,The item arrived in a timely manner. The material is comfy and fits to the body nicely. It's exactly what I wanted.
3406,Super cute but I think I should have gone with a small instead of medium. Next purchase though!
3407,the material is nice and comfy!!!
3408,"fits very well! material is nice, will order more :)"
3409,This was just the bottom not the top
3410,"good bathing suit, front is a little weird"
3411,"As a woman with a larger backside, the prospect of finding a sexy bathing suit in a 2XL was very exciting. You can only imagine my dissapointment upon receiving the package, that the bathing suit sent to me was labeled ONE SIZE FITS ALL! Any larger/plus size woman knows, that something labeled ""One Size Fits All"" is not only dreadful, but destined to not fit. This bathing suit definitely fit into that category. I am so disappointed by this. It's been difficult to say the least trying to find a larger thong bikini, only to be filled with utter disappointment. Don't offer multiple sizes if your aren't actually going to send them. Avoid the disappointment and dare I say false advertisment and skip on this if you're woman with larger butt."
3412,"Contacted the seller bc the bottoms do NOT fit true to size. I tried to exchange them for a larger size, but the seller was not willing to exchange them even though they have never been work and still have the sanitation strip inside of them. If you are looking for a thong bottom do not purchase from this seller it is a waste of money"
3413,"Love it fits perfectly. I got a size S and I am 5'8"" 125 lbs."
3414,"amazing!!! we got six of them and we are all obsessed!!! the quality and fit is amazing, the colours are so vibrant, and the material is awesome!!! Not to mention it came in literally a week!? Such outstanding customer service too, we received so mich help with every inquiry we had!! Would 12/10 purchase again!!"
3415,Fast shipping and looks exactly like the picture! Ordered for a Halloween costume which will work perfectly and I also plan on wearing it again as a bathing suit too
3416,This was perfect for my 80's workout barbie halloween costume - and came SO quick - thank you so much!
3417,"This is really cute and I loved wearing it for halloween. It would make a cute bathing suit too! Shipped very fast, thank you! I'm 5'2, size 8, M, 32DD. I ordered a large and it was perfect"
3418,I used it for my Halloween wand It was adorable and fit so well!!
3419,"Very very fast shipping and great quality! A bit small/short for a taller person, im 125 lbs and 5'7"" and its just a tad short for my body, but ill make it work. love it!"
3420,"AMAZING! Good quality, fast shipping AND she was an efficient and fabulous communicator! I ordered 12 and they came within a week! 
Highly recommend ❤️"
3421,"I love this product! Awesome quality and shipped in no time. Only complaint is the sizing. It does run a little large so I would size down. I am usually between xs/s, went with the s and wish I would’ve went with xs. Still fits, but is a little loose especially in the bust. My measurements are: 5’4.5, 128 lbs, 32 bust, 25 waist, 34 hips. Hope this helps!"
3422,"Love my item so much, great quality and so cute! Also I was beyond impressed with SunnyshopbyOlesea! Fast response time, awesome communication, very personalized and wonderful experience purchasing!"
3423,Loved Barbie suit for my halloween costume! Will wear again as a normal swimsuit..and the shipping was super fast!
3424,"I’m 5’2”, 145lbs, a 36C and the medium fit perfectly! Not too tight,not too loose & feels comfy."
3425,Absolutely love it! I bought this for a Halloween costume and it fit true to size. I typically order a large and was pleased that it fit! Personally wished it had some padding in it but other than that it was perfect!
3426,This came so fast and was perfect for my Halloween costume. It fit exactly how I wanted as well! Thank you!
3427,Exactly as described and worked perfect for my costume!
3428,A bit see through — overall true to size! Made a wonderful piece to a Halloween costume. Would buy here again!
3429,Fit perfectly!! I loved it!!
3430,"The suit came quickly and it is perfect!! Thank you so much, I would definitely recommend. The pink is a beautiful color and will work perfectly for my halloween costume."
3431,loved it perfect for halloween
3432,Great item! Fits amazing and looks super cute. I wish it did come in cuter packaging though because it is an adorable suit but everything else was perfect.
3433,"I'm 5' 11"" I weigh 185lbs (ordered XL). The suit fits well, I think the crotch is too wide. Beyond that it is perfect, the lettering is gorgeous !!!! It is high quality."
3434,I’ve gotten nothing but compliments on this. It’s a super fun suit. No shrinkage or tears after multiple washes and wears.
3435,Love this item! So soft and comfy. I'm 5'5 around 145 and a medium fit perfect :)
3436,Perfect for the Barbie costume I wanted to do wish they had pink 😊
3437,"ABSOTOODAHLOUTELY LALALOVE my new bathingsuit! fits amazing FAST shipping and i look awesome lol....wonder if i can use it as a shirt "")"

3445,Looked great for halloween and can definitely be repurposed!
3446,Fit well! Super cute for my Halloween costume just wish it wasn’t such thin material.
3447,"Loved the bright pink color. Fit wasn’t what I expected. Was a little too low for my chest than I would’ve liked, and you definitely need some padding because the material will show every bump. Wore this with a bra for my Photoshoot & did the job."
3448,Fit great. Fast Shipping. Just as pictured
3449,I absolutely love this! Fit perfectly and shipped very quickly! Thank you so much
3450,"Livré rapidement ! On a hâte de les essayer :)
Merci encore !!!"
3451,"Exactly as described, super cute, and should be perfect for our Honeymoon!!!"
3452,Such good quality and received it in about 3 days after ordering!! Definitely would recommend
3453,"5’8 bought a large. Straps are a little tight for my height and my boobs are not snugged in, but fits nicely everywhere else."
3454,Order came super fast and is just like the other pictures. It’s not revealing and can wear with tights or by itself comfortably! Recommend buying!
3455,Very sexy! I love the pink and how it says Barbie !
3456,"Passform und Farbe des Badeanzuges ist super. Schriftart und Farbe wurden nachgefragt und individuell angefertigt.

3487,Arrived quickly. As advertised and fit well.
3488,"The service I received from Cupcakes & Chopsticks was wonderful throughout. Great, reassuring communication with the seller, super-fast delivery and beautiful, unique swimming costume to take on holiday. It's really excellent quality and a very flattering fit. Thank you!"
3489,"This is my second one of these, love the shape :)"
3490,"Absolutely gorgeous, arrived really quickly. I've seen a few reviews that say these swimsuits aren't good for tall people - I'm 5'10'' and this fits me just fine. Really pleased!"
3491,Loved it so much I bought another one in the same style. Thanks
3492,"The swimsuit is gorgeous, but keep in mind UK16-18 might run a bit tight. I exchanged it with a 18-20 Red Pin Stripe. I have nothing but compliments on the customer service and heartily recommend the shop"
3493,Gorgeous! Great fit. Really flattering.
3494,It's beautiful thank you! Exactly how I hoped.
3495,"Exactly what I wanted! This shipped so fast and the quality is remarkable! Definitely not the seller's fault, but it is a little small for me. I'm 5'2 and 145 lbs and ordered a large, but it only fits if I adjust it right. But I’m not one to complain because showing a little skin on the beach isn’t the worst thing. ;)"
3496,"SO cute! Got my new last name written on it and took pics to surprise the hubby... Also as all other reviewers mention, order a size up. I am a SM and ordered a MED and its perfect. A SM would have never fit! Good quality, going to take and wear on my honeymoon in Europe :) 
Thanks again! OXOX"
3497,"The swimsuit came in a very timely fashion! Seller was very helpful and quick to respond to my questions. It looks amazing. I bought the white suit with gold writing for a friends bridal shower gift. I got her the M/L looks good in sizing, thick/good quality material and even padded boob inserts attached!"
3498,"I have been waiting a couple of years to finally be able to order this swimsuit! Now that my wedding and honeymoon are almost here, I finally got to order the Mrs. swimsuit and I love it! I think it was probably my fault, as I didn't include Mrs. with my last name on the order, but the suit came with just my new last name and I actually love it as is! The shop owner responded immediately and offered to immediately ship out a corrected suit. However because I loved it as is except for the suit being slightly large for my personal taste, I just requested a smaller size with the same words. The swimsuit is great quality, the printing is perfect and the shop owner is super responsive and helpful! I would definitely order from her again. I can't wait to wear this on my
honeymoon!!"
3499,I love this suit so much. The quality is great (there are even cups which was a nice surprise) and it's super cute. Downside is it runs very small. I ordered a M/L which usually fits me but alas way too small. I'm 5'7''  and I regret not asking the shop owner which size she recommended because I can't return :(
3500,"Had a hiccup with ordering a correct size. Angie, the shop owner, was AMAZING. She took care of all of my concerns promptly and professionally !!! I hope to continue using her amazing services. Swimsuit is great quality and writing was done really well."
3501,I ordered a large and I am a size 6 and it was wayyyy too tiny!
3502,The swimming suit fit AMAZING and I received so many compliments. Shipping was fast and on time. I definitely recommend this product!
3503,perfect in every way! I ordered up to a medium and it fits snug but well!
3504,"Thank you!!! It's perfect, I love it, my husband loves it & I can't wait to hit the beach."
3505,Fast shipping! Bride to be loved it!
3506,So excited to wear this on my honeymoon!
3507,SO CUTE! Bride to be loved it!
3508,Quick turnaround. They were very quick to respond to my order I placed! Love the bathing suit! I can't wait to wear it on my honeymoon 😀
3509,Love my swimsuit that's perfect can't wait to use it and is so cute
3510,I truly like the design...colors went well together. Service was quick. Unfortunately the letters began to peel after one swim in the ocean on vacation.
3511,"The suit was great quality, fit perfectly. The only complaint I had was that the letters started to fall off after 4 hours of wearing the suit and not even going into the water."
3512,"The size chart is off (unless I missed the memo that these are children’s sizes). The measurements don’t match the product and furthermore there’s no way the large would be constituted as a large  even if the measurements did match! I purchased this for my honeymoon and rushed the shipping to ensure timely delivery. Which means I paid $50 for this suit. But when I received the suit, which looked like the smallest large I ever seen, she pretty much said it’s not her fault and said I’d have to pay another $30 to take another chance on it. I’ll pass. 

I wish Etsy would let me upload a picture on a bad review so you could see how small this large was."
3513,"I'm so delighted by the top! Bill was absolutely helpful every step of the way, made sure I was happy with my color choices, and was very easy to work with. I can't wait to wear it at our anniversary pool party, thanks again!"
3514,I went to a renn fair and tried one on. I LOVED it. The style is great and it fit perfectly. I was just upset that I didn't have money at the time to buy it! But I ordered one a little over 6 weeks ago. Hopefully it will be here soon! I can't wait :)
3515,Super sexy... & different!! ❤️😁
3516,AMAZING! Absolutely loved this will not take it off when out DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY!
3517,Thank you very much. The bathing suit fits comfortably and is a good size. It's very well done! Thank you very much <3
3518,"This is just the beginning of a long, happy relationship with Bill's craft..."
3519,"Perfect! I was worried that this would be hard to fit for my larger size, but it's awesome, fits well and is comfortable.  I've gotten many lovely compliments on it and I can't wait to order more Utopia Armory stuff in the near future! :)"
3520,"Love this company! Super communicative and amazing quality. 

This piece(bronze) comes with instructions on how to wear and wash :)"
3521,"Beautiful and comfortable, just as I knew it would be."
3522,Love it!  So sexy and a great deal!
3523,Good quality friendly service. Thanks
3524,"Love it, great fit, fun and funky. 2nd purchase from bikiniboo. You can tell the fit is really thought about, i’m Curvy so find it hard to find bikini bottoms that are flattering and these are just perfect 👌 thank you I feel super confident x"
3525,"Ok, these bathing suits are life altering for me! I had back to back c sections and have this weird pooch that I didn’t have before. Regular bikini bottoms were immediately out of the question. One pieces are a big maybe depending on the print. Kerry answered my million questions and helped me with the right size. She even did a custom order for me! I literally almost started crying when I put on her bathing suits! I finally felt decent in a swimsuit again! I am buying two more with a different print because they’re so fabulous!"
3526,This is my second suit and I love it! Bow didn’t hold up as well after it got wet but safety pins saved the day!
3527,shipping time was so much shorter than I thought! it arrived in about a week even with the holidays! the bathing suit is adorable & awesome price. the seller is so sweet and will help you pick the perfect size. thank you so much!! :)
3528,"I was very nervous about buying a suit online, but this one is perfect. The quality is great and it's comfortable! There were some shipping issues that had nothing to do with the seller, but Kerry was extremely responsive and did everything she could including prepping another suit to ship out if my original didn't turn up. I would happily buy another suit from Kerry."
3529,"super cute ,and fit me perfect"
3530,"This suit is just perfect. I sent my measurements and I received a beautiful suit! Very worth the price, shipping time, and risk for purchasing something online. Very pleased!"
3531,"The bottoms were a bit of a surprise that I would describe as a very light furry material to the feel, not by sight. I purchased 3 suits this style and can not wait to order more! All promises by Bikiniboo have proved to be true!
Sweet personal notes & descriptive emails. Looking to order more! I love this seller!!  You can’t go wrong!"
3532,"Adorable. Kerry was a pleasure to conduct business with.  Very eager to help.  Just love this suit.... very “edgy “
Chic...."
3533,Amazing item! Loved it so much I had to order another for my holidays later in the year! Thanks again
3534,The bathing suit was cute but didn’t work for me.  Kerry was so sweet and the communication was great.  She made it easy for me to return.
3535,"The quality of this bikini is amazing! I can't thank Kerry enough for answering my questions and providing excellent customer service. Thank you so much :) You just gained a loyal customer for life. x
★★★★★"

3549,Never received package and seller never refunded me.
3550,Never received it and it's been almost a month..
3551,I contacted this shop in a panic to get matching swim suites for my bachelorette party that would take place the weekend after a potential order! The owner answered me within a few minutes and assured me the package would be here in a few days and holy cow I couldn’t believe it!! All the way in Alaska and they made it! Not to mention how cute they are! I’m so appreciative of this shop and will be recommending them to everyone! !!
3552,Perfect customer service. The seller was very responsive to all my questions and talked me through the whole process. I can’t wait to wear my pink BRIDE swimsuit for my bachelorette party.
3553,Fast shipping and item was perfect. Thank you!
3554,"I really really dislike bathing suit shopping. But I really really enjoyed my experience with Visual Mood. The seller responded to my questions super fast and helped me select the right size given my measurements are a little all over the map. Not only was the service excellent, but this is the nicest suit I’ve ever owned. It fits well, it’s flattering, and it’s well constructed. I would highly recommend this shop to everyone."
3555,beautiful swimsuits.  they fit well and are well constructed.  I'm a US size 12 and the large fit perfectly.  I've worn each one once and each time have gotten compliments already.
3556,"Item arrived right away. Nice colors, just like the picture."
3557,Beautiful suit. Super fast shipping. Thank you!
3558,Purchase received with thanks 🌷
3559,it was good material but it did not fit right around the boobs at all and i could not get the adjustment straps to work well
3560,Very cute triangle top. I’m small busted (34A) and the top suits my body nicely. I also love the tan lining because it conceals very well. Good structure & the braided top part is adorable!
3561,"Absolutely love! Love, love. 
Very soft, beautiful material. Very much worth the purchase. 

Medium is a small. Did not fit my DD, exchanged for a large."
3562,Thank you for this amazing bikini top. I'm in love with it . 😊
3563,Absolutely amazing quality! Will definitely be making more purchases in the future!!!!
3564,"really like this top, it mixes and matches well with so many of my bikini bottoms!"
3565,Absolutely gorgeous! Store bought quality. Arrived super fast. Thank you so much! Keep making them and I’ll keep buying
3566,"I'm 140lbs, 34DD and the Large fit perfectly!  I love it!!!"
3567,Yes love it!! UNBELIEVABLE quick ship!! Thank you!

3571,I love my swimsuit and so did everyone else! Thanks so much
3572,This bathing suit is perfect. It’s a stunner.
3573,"Very Beautiful piece! Bathing Suit looks exactly as the photo, if not better! The material is nice and thick, the colors are bold and vibrant. I received lots of compliments. Shipping was a little delayed but seller communicated fast and took care of it. I Love it!"
3574,"This swimsuit is the best. It's super flattering, bright and fun. I got tons of compliments and love wearing it. Also the seller was fantastic. When I needed a new size it was super easy to return and get a replacement. Highly recommend."
3575,"This is the coolest bathing suit EVER! I love finding new ways to wear it. It can be worn with full coverage or more skin showing, it's super flattering, and the colors are so bright and fun. 10/10 would recommend."
3576,"Love the suit, I just can't figure out how to get it tied the way I would like and the video wasn't much help. But I'm sure I'll be able to figure it out and it wear it comfortably on the beach."
3577,I always wanted one of these swimsuits and excited to finally have one! Thank you for making a suit that fits all shapes and sizes!
3578,Absolutely love this unique versatile bathing suit. It’s-well made and you can wear it so many different ways. I love it. Thank you. Fast shipment too.
3579,This swimsuit is super cute! It's really unique and I love the many options I have to style it. Thank you!
3580,"This is an absolutely beautiful swimsuit. I ordered the 1X and it fit perfectly, and I received it just a few days after ordering. However, there are two things to be aware of. First, the top portion isn't lined and I was very self conscious that people could see through it at the beach/pool. Second, the video doesn't show how to wear it like the plus size model in the picture, which is the reason I ordered it."
3581,I love the vibrant colors and the quality. Pictures don't do this justice.
3582,"Love this bathing suit, the colors are very bright.....can't wait to wear it!!!"
3583,AWESOME bathing suit! The bright colors really pop and the fit is perfect (and flexible).  Fast shipping and a personal note made it extra special.
3584,"This bathing suit is beautiful and made well.
great fabric, very versatile can be worn so many styles."
3585,"All I can say is....LOVE IT!  Fits perfectly and has vibrant colors, easy to clean. I really like that I can wear it in many different ways. Shipped very quickly, just in time for my vacation! Thank you!"
3586,Beautifully made and the colours are SO vibrant! Can’t wait to wear this unique bathing suit next summer :)
3587,I LOVE it! It fits perfectly and the quality is great. Will def be purchasing other swimsuits.
3588,I love the suit. One problem is I really need help in wrapping. The tutorial that was referenced wasn't helpful. I need one showing how to wrap this suit
3589,Love my swim suit!!! Thank you for the fast shipment!
3590,Really lovely in-person! Will have to get ideas on how to wear it best to suit my frame there’s so many options.
3591,"It's perfect, I would love to have it in all black."
3592,"Beautiful swimsuit and very well-made. Just as bright as the pictures. The post office lost my order, and the seller had great communication and made sure that I got it my item, stress-free."
3593,The bathing suit is stunning!! I can't wait to wear it in PR. Thank you.
3594,"Swimsuit is great.  Great colors!  But be careful with the size. I usually wear S, rarely -M, but this item I would feel more comfortable in M"
3595,LOVED the swimwear. Couldn't wait to wear it. I recievesd so many compliments it.
3596,I absolutely ❤ this bathing suit. The seller has excellent communication and is 5 star! Can't wait to take pictures in it. Thank you!
3597,This item is sooooo fun. I can't wait to wear it.
3598,Love the color and it compliments my dark skin so well
3599,"This item shipped in a reasonable time frame, I love the colours of this swimsuit, and the size is perfect.  But... if only it had another layer in the part that covers the chest.  I understand it's meant to be tied different ways, but no matter which way you tie it, there is a certain part that will be covering the chest.  I am going to have to get some kind of insert made or alteration done before I am able to wear it, the fabric is so thin.  That is the only reason for my lower star rating."
3600,Gorgeous can’t wait to rock this in the summer.
3601,"Very colorful, unique, and versatile."
3602,So cute i got an xl (i wear a large) and it fit perfectly
3603,I LOVE MY SUIT! it fits perfectly. They were really nice I forgot to write my customized text and color choices but I wrote the seller and they still did it for w/o a problem.  It arrived early
3604,"I love the suit. Color and gold glitter lettering exactly what I hoped for. The Medium was a little different fitting than I had hoped but, still love it!"
3605,"Picture will be posted in a few weeks. It’s a high quality suit and fits very well. Definitely size up, as it runs small. But  I’m so excited to show off on my cruise and surprise my girls with they’re matching pieces."
3606,"Bought these for a bachelorette, followed the sizing instructions and they fit well. Perfect for our lake side celebration!"
3607,Got them for my bachelorette and wedding events and they were great! Great size writing and the white one was not see through. I’m 5’3” and a 34D and M size would fit me perfect (but I got and L because I was a bit worried about the bust area). Also loved the fuchsia one I got.
3608,"Custom one-piece bathingsuit is so cute, fits true to size (I don't think it actually runs small), and the white color is not see-through at all, which I was concerned about. It shipped faster than expected & I love it! Thanks! 😊"
3609,Awesome  buys super helpful my order came super fast (see other reviews)
3610,"Great item , fits perfect and lettering is applied beautifully"
3611,Fit well the only thing its cut a little higher by the bikini line then expected. All in all the quality is really nice.
3612,Love it! Not for tall girls though. I’m 5’9 and it’s a bit too short
3613,Perfect for a bachelorette party! Great fit!
3614,The quality is great and loved the lettering. My only problem is it runs short. I ordered a Large and its snug but will do for my 50th bday.
3615,It was great sizing and the material is nice !
3616,Suit fits nice I would suggest sizing up for a roomier fit in the booty. The lettering is beautiful and seems sturdy quality. Excited to wear on vacation !
3617,Super fast shipping!! Thank you!
3618,Size up 1 maybe 2 sizes.
3619,Runs small. Order up. Overall good quality
3620,Quick shipping and fits as expected.
3621,"I ordered two items, one pre-printed by ""strongsexy"" which they spelled incorrectly, and a 2nd which I chose. The 2nd item was correct, however the horrible customer service, and refusal to replace the item with the error brings down their rating. Quoting me a 3 day and 7 day SLA. I did not notice the error until someone pointed it out to me. That is embarrassing. 

I had to file a claim with my bank due to their lack of customer service. My friend also ordered from them, and never received her item. Strongsexy did not replace her item, and I am sorry that I referred her to them. I will advise my friends not to use his vendor."
3622,can't review it cause I never received the item. I dont know whose fault it was but my money was not refunded and no item was received.
3623,"Again, beijo hit it out of the park!!!! This is my 3rd bikini and I couldn't be happier!!! Such a gorgeous, quality made bikini!! It fits perfectly and is sooo beautiful!!! Thank you!!! 💜"
3624,"This is my first bikini from this seller, and I absolutely love it! It is very high-quality, and I can tell that it is built to last. I love how it is a designer piece, but unlike some other designer bikinis, you don't have to baby it - you can swim in the ocean and pool without worrying. The seller was very responsive. When the first top she shipped me before my vacation didn't fit quite right (it was probably me who messed up the measurements I sent!), she fixed the sizing and made sure the new top got to me before I left for my trip. Thanks so much! I can't wait to order another."
3625,So in love with this!!!! Wow!!!! It is even more beautiful in person!! Fits perfectly!!! Thank you so much!!! <3
3626,BEAUTIFUL design! AMAZING style! PERFECT fit! GREAT service! A+ communication & service! Would HIGHLY recommend! Alicia
3627,"She is a master of her craft. I sent her my measurements, although taking the measurement pictures proved hard to do alone she was still able to decipher my crappy pictures and create this amazing swimsuit that fits me better than any swimsuit I have ever purchased (and I've purchased ALOT). Even though the swimsuit is on the more revealing side, because it fits SO well I find that it is extremely comfortable and I don't feel like I'll fall out or have to make any adjustments to avoid any ""moments"". The suit is beyond my expectations and well worth the money and wait. I would've waited 3x the amount of time then what I actually did. BRAVO! I will definitely be coming back for more. Thanks a million!!"
3628,"Amazing design, quality and fit! It's actually incredible how they manage such a flawless fit of the bikini from miles away! The thread used is really nice too! 
Easily the best bikini I've ever worn and on of the best pieces of clothing I've ever worn in general.
Communication with the seller excelllent and fast delivery.

Thanks a lot!"
3629,Purchased for my wife.  OMG came in absolutely perfect.  Can't wait for our vaca for her to flaunt that gorgeous body in this.
3630,Thank you so much for the amazing bikini bottoms. They look so great and the bonus sunglasses bag was so amazing & unexpected.💋💋💋 This is going to make my summer so awesome 😎
3631,Best online shop! The person who makes these take pride in their work and mail out fast! I bought 2 more and will always shop this shop first!
3632,This is perfect! Just what I was looking for!
3633,It is very comfortable and looks great. It got to me just in time for pool weather.
3634,"This skirt fits perfectly!
So Flattering on too!"
3635,Love this so much! It’s adorable!
3636,"Fits perfect, great quality, doesn’t hurt my neck when I wear it."
3637,Super cute! Very nice seller! I will definitely come back for more in the near future!!!
3638,"Perfect coverage, excellent quality at a wonderful price"
3639,My daughter love it.
3640,So cute! Daughter loves them!!
3641,item was not as shown in the picture. the picture showed a navy blue top and i got a royal blue top. the stitching was awful and i was very disappointed.
3642,"These cover ups are adorable. They're a bit more sheer than I imagined but nonetheless they're beautiful. Also note Etsies: they go high up on the sides of the thighs and long on the front and back. So if you're not afraid to show some leg, these are great. Seriously beautiful designs, I'll definitely be sporting these on my summer vacation this month!"
3643,"Absolutely love this cover-up! It was perfect for my honeymoon. I do wish I would have purchased the medium instead of a large. The top/straps on the large are too big and fall off my shoulders. Overall, it's very cute!"
3644,"LOVE, LOVE IT!! VERY EXCITED to wear it to the pool, and the beach! And whats even better, is I don't feel comfortable and sexy in most bathing suit cover ups. This is due to being plus size. But this makes me feel AWESOME!!!! Cindy was AMAZING in communication, and doing a custom size for me!! This is VERY MUCH APPRECIATED AND SPEAK VOLUMES of your customer service! :D Would be EXTREMELY interested in more cute stuff from your store!!! Have you thought about broadening it to other cute little jumpers and etc?"
3645,"LOVE, love, love this beautiful cover-up!  The quality and craftsmanship is first rate!  HIGHLY recommend!"
3646,"Soo many good things to say about this experience and product; so little time!!! :) First of all, THANK YOU for getting this to me in time for a boat excursion when I failed to calculate shipping and when I would need, seriously you are a life saver, and that was so kind of you to ship to me ensuring I had it by the date requested!!!!! Secondly, this is the most beautiful cover up I have ever seen, and I got a ton of compliments, and it was so perfectly flattering and well made. It really popped in the sun, and felt dressy and different. Bottom line; I will be back for more, and highly recommend others do the same!"
3647,Super super fast shipping! This is my second time ordering from Cindy's shop and everything always arrives looking exactly like the picture with great quality material. The cover ups are adorable and I would recommend this shop to anyone!
3648,"The coverup that I bought for my bathing suit is perfect. The material was top notch and the gold accents made it appear much 
more expensive than other boutiques that sell cover- ups. Upon my 
request the owner placed a snap on the front to make it fit better on 
me. I only wish is that they made shorts in the same style. The cover-up was also sent to me straight away. I was startled to find it on my door step so quickly. I ordered a size medium after I read the 
size guide and sending the owner my dimensions. It fit perfectly.  I will shop from this store again. Thank you."
3649,I love the cover up it is beautiful I love it. It fits perfect and it came on time and loved the personal note.
3650,I love this beautiful cover up! I will be ordering another in a different color next summer! It was perfect for my honeymoon in Mexico! Thank you so much for getting it to me on time!
3651,"Exactly what I wanted, perfect for the beach!"
3652,"It's a loose comfortable fit. Perfect for a hot summer day. The lace back is such a girly touch, looked great! Lozasun was easy to contact and great to purchase from--quick easy shipping! Thank you"
3653,"I could not be happier with my cover up, it is beautifully made and fits great! Now I just need the weather to warm up so I can wear it!"
3654,"So adorable. The perfect cover up for summer. Super light, easy to wear, and very convenient!"
3655,Absolutely beautiful and such nice quality!! I'm so excited to wear it on our honeymoon!
3656,Absolutely beautiful and is made beautifully.  High quality. So impressed.
3657,Item is beautiful and she took the time to include a thank you card. I should be thanking you! You rushed it to me so I would have it for my trip. Awesome seller!!!!!
3658,It's perfect and I'm in love
3659,Great cover up!  I got lots of compliments on it at the beach too.  It was mailed to me in the exact time frame she said too.
3660,Gorgeous! love it!  Seller is great with communication.
3661,"Love the cover up! I ended up changing my mind about the color options after I purchased and she accommodated. Very nice, thank you so much!"
3662,Beautiful.  The gold is very shiny so people will see me coming.
3663,"These are BEAUTIFUL!
They rushed my order per my impending vacation & helped me take advantage of a discount they had going of which I was unaware.
Super friendly - will purchase from again."
3664,So beautiful I love it!
3665,Super cute and sexy. Couldn't be happier.
3666,"i love it, exactly as described and an amazing seller, refunded me some of the postage price when they realised it was cheaper. such integrity. thank you!"
3667,"The item arrived very quickly, despite being shipped over a holiday weekend, and was packaged beautifully! I highly recommend this cover up and and seller and I plan to purchase more in the future!"
3668,Perfect swimsuit cover up. Had so many compliments!!! Needed it quick for a vacation and it arrived on time. Would order again.
3669,Love this! Very well made and shipped quickly! Beautiful.
3670,"Beautiful, great fit, great color!"
3671,"Its beautiful and fits perfectly, however the main material is very delicate and snags easily."
3672,"Very polite, responsive shop owner. Dress was just as described!"
3673,Can't wait to wear next week!
3674,"I received this custom bathing suit so quickly! Putting it on, it was easy in, easy out but solid in construction with no worries of slippage. 

I did however have to send it back for a few modifications. Being a 38DDD on a good day, makes bathing suit shopping a sketchy prospect. LILYSHDesign was eager and willing to accept a shipment and make the necessary alterations to make for a perfect fit. I'm so excited to get it back and reveal this masterpiece. 

Totally worth it's weight in gold and so pleasant to work with! 

Big Ladies, medium Ladies and little ladies alike, can't go wrong with this gem. 😁😁👍👍👍👍👍"
3675,There was a little challenge in getting the swimsuit on but once I got everything to lay right....how sexy was I??? Thanks for making a curvy woman be proud to flaunt her curves.
3676,"I love the way the suit fits, I wore it this past weekend and got so many compliments."
3677,"Honestly, this is the best swimsuit I have ever had! It has always been hard for me to find a swimsuit in my size that is actually flattering. I really enjoy that I can show off my backside in this, haha. Just know it will press your chest down, but you don't have to worry about accidentally flashing someone!

The quality it top notch, and the fit is great! The seller kept me updated throughout the entire process, and was happy to work with me when I had some concerns!

I now have my dream swimsuit ready for my vacation! There is no doubt that I will order from this seller again! Best designs ever!"
3678,"Hi! 
     I hate giving bad reviews but, this was the biggest dissapoinment ever.  I gave her my measurements but it was way too big and the crotch area is a different fabric and it looks awful. Maybe if it fits perfectly you can't see it. I think is a super hot swimsuit... But is one of
those that have to fit absolutely perfectly... Mine didn't at all. 

     Anyways, if you take the risk and it doesn't fit you can always wear it with a high up skirt for clubbing. I guess....

Sorry Liliah"
3679,This bathing suit is the most brilliant design - so flattering! :) Thank you so much!!
3680,"Super sexy...Love it!

3681,"Great seller. Accommodated my custom order, which I really appreciate"
3682,"The suit fits really well on my curves when adjusted to my body and it arrived on time. There was an excellent communication with the seller.
However I feel that the fabric is quite uncomfortable especially they way it sits on the neck and buttocks/crotch area, it's really uncomfortable almost enough to keep you from wearing the swimsuit! I believe if the designer adresses these issues the suit would be a 10/10."
3683,Super sexy on....enhances my curves and hides any imperfections....love this swimsuit!
3684,Loved it. Just as I thought
3685,"good product , lovely design"
3686,"It looks great in the pictures and the other reviews had me really excited to purchase this (very expensive) custom bathing suit. That being said, the seller was great when I initially ordered - she answered my questions quickly, and even volunteered to send it express as I needed the item for vacation that week. BUT once I received it, it was a disaster. Even after sending her my measurements, it was far too tight in the bust (not in a sexy way) and had a ton of extra fabric near the lower belly (a pouch big enough to fit a good sized cereal bowl). She assured me if the suit didn't fit I could get alternations at no extra charge,but took a month to get the suit back to me and it still doesn't fit. I emailed her a week ago regarding the fit and still haven't heard anything back. It was a waste of $100."
3687,"So first and foremost, customer service is excellent. Through no fault of the shop, I did not receive my swimsuit. USPS lost it. I contacted the seller and was immediately responded to. She told me she would refund me but I requested a new one, which she sent immediately. This top is amazing. The quality is fantastic. I am flat chested but this suit actually made me look like I had cleavage. Highly recommend!"
3688,Perfect top for the matching bottom!
3689,Received this really fast and the quality is excellent.  Love it!
3690,"Amazing seller who was really responsive to my questions about the fiber content! I have a polyester allergy so I had to make sure these didn't contain any, and to make sure I didn't have any issues they even used a special waistband! I've swum with them a few times now and they're great, I'd just advise you order down if you're unsure of your size. I was worried the shorts would be too tight in the size I ordered, but they're actually just the right size and edging to slightly looser than I like (but still a perfectly acceptable size, I just get nervous) when wet from swimming for awhile."
3691,Love them
3692,Unique style and very flattering boyshort fit. Love them!
3693,Super great swim shorts. I feel very comfortable in them. Great material. 10/10
3694,This thing is great. I adore it! ♡
3695,"LOVE IT! I asked for this special and I was so glad he did it, I’ve never been disappointed by this shop and I’ve been buying here for years."
3696,Beautiful and I love it!!! Thank you!!
3697,"HVALA! PERFECT, as expected; what is this the 50th time I bought from your shop? LOL 
Here is to many more of your truly amazing designs!!
HUGZZZZZ"
3698,I ordered three of these suits for our synchronized swim team. Chavdar was great to do business with!  His communications with me were prompt and very helpful. He made the suits on time and sent them immediately. They are very very well made and we can't wait to glitter them up for competition!!  I will post a photo of them when they are finished.
3699,Love it! great job! It's a bit tight at first but after use it feels great!
3700,"Also GORGEOUS! Stunning in photos, and I swear, this is a miracle bikini - I felt great, well supported, and couldn't take a bad photo if I tried! It was thick and opaque so no worries about being see-through, but it still dried quickly and was comfortable to wear - no chafing or sticking.  I absolutely love it and would recommend to all! I did get the cheeky bottom, which is super sexy but if you want to be a little more PG, just ask for another bottom. Thanks so much for getting it to me in time for my vacation Dragana, you are so talented! Please note that it is a handmade, unique item so make sure to factor that in your estimated shipping time if you are ordering, it is not something that comes overnight!"
3701,"Beautiful handmade Bikini,,, she loves it! Well worth the short wait. Thank You!"
3702,Exactly like the picture! I love it ☺️
3703,"Suzanna is one of the best designers and sellers on Etsy! She is so kind and helpful and her work is divine! It is the nicest swimsuit I've ever seen, and I was left speechless. It is not easy finding a swimsuit we feel comfortable in, but this has to be the one! With a perfect torso length and coverage and still being modern and feminine, it would flatter everybody. It fits true to size. Material is beautiful!!! I love it so much! Thank you so much Suzanna!!!"
3704,"Wirklich total schön der Badeanzug. Obwohl er schlicht ist, hat er etwas Besonderes an sich. Suzanna ist wirklich sehr herzlich und bemüht. Ich hoffe auf noch mehr von 1979, Unterwäsche wäre auch toll."
3705,"The seller is extremely easy to reach, the material of the swimsuit is so soft and durable and arrived super quick!"
3706,Beautiful and such nice cut and fabric thank you!
3707,LOVED this item! Communication between seller was slim to none but the product was still amazing
3708,Super soft and quick shipping!
3709,"Purchased the camo bikini. Just as pictured. Fit is great, one of the best fitting triangle bathing suit tops I've ever had! Love the back of the suit bottoms as well."
3710,"Super cute and well-made. I am a size 8-10 pants and a DD-DDD bra and I ordered XL sizes for both top and bottom. Even in an XL, they are on the smaller side for my size. Great for showing off the goods but wouldn't wear to a family BBQ. Bathing suits have always been hard, but this worked. Would buy again, especially if they made a XXL. Thanks!"
3711,"Amazing! Asked for a special cut on the bottoms and it came perfect! Love this shop, so cute!!"
3712,Love my camo bikini! I asked for an XXL in the order comments and she made it for me just as I asked. Thank you!!
3713,Bottom runs small but sexy cut. great quality suit. Love it! Looking to buy more from this shop. Thanks!!
3714,"Great material and finishings from Fahrenheit's shop, perfect size and really wonderful bikini, thank you!
P.s. the packaging was so lovely also. 
Greetings from Italy , byyyyyee!"
3715,"Olivia is the best! She's such a fast responder and makes sure you are happy with your purchase ! Great shop!

Just when I thought this shop was great, Olivia proved it was even more  than just great!!! Thank you so much for your help in my exchange and even more unexpected amazing surprise !!!!!"
3716,This fit me perfectly. I'm so glad I ordered the XL bottom because it's perfect! I can't wait to get to the beach.
3717,Best fit out of any swim suit I have ever tried on! Great customer service who helped talk me through the sizing for my favorite swim bikini ever!
3718,Perfect. I'm in love with this shop.
3719,Super cute ! Love this bikini but the top is REALLY small so if you're in between a small and medium I'd recommend a medium.
3720,Amazing seller. I love what I received. Very happy.
3721,fits like a glove! Quality is very high and is really flattering on and true to size.
3722,"Sizing is perfect! Arrived before expected ship date, super fast shipping and great products"
3723,Fantastic service from this shop!!!
3724,Could have padded the top
3725,"The customer service is wonderful. I've been in contact with the vendor from the beginning and she has always been very responsive and prompt. Shipping was also very quick. I was worried about getting the item in on time since I currently live in Turkey and had a competition date quickly approaching but Amber was able to ship it out quickly with plenty of wiggle room. The bikini looked beautiful in photos. The colour really popped and the sequins added that extra shine. Overall great quality, customer service, and affordable price!"
3726,It’s is perfect. Shipped way quicker than I expected. I love it. Will definitely purchase another one from her for my next show.
3727,"While my bathing suit was good quality it wasn’t exactly as pictured and the bottom doesn’t look quite like I was expecting. Its more full coverage than I was expecting it to be. The middle connector is different than the one pictures :( it’s still very well made and the color is very pretty, just wish the back was truly a pro cut."
3728,"The suit is beautiful and the colour is true to the picture. It did, however, have a different connector on the top between the cups then what was pictured. The seller was very helpful with sizing questions and was very prompt when returning my communication."
3729,Great to work with!  Love it!
3730,Beautiful bikini! Fits great! Prompt reply to questions.
3731,I haven't received the product yet. I placed the order on 2nd Nov but still didn't receive it. Though the seller has been prompt on all my replies but as there is no tracking option. So can't even know anything about it. I assume it's lost in the transit.
3732,Shipping took awhile but I knew that in advance. It is nicely made.
3733,Amazing! very fast shipping and perfect material
3734,It's very nice - I feel like it could be a little bigger to ensure best coverage.
3735,Love love love. I so glad I found this shop. The perfect bikini top for my girls. Thank you.❤
3736,I ordered this top in purple and turquoise. The colors are amazing together. Bright and fun. I had the original shipment altered which was completed super fast and the fit is perfect.
3737,I am in love with this shop! I have ordered several items and each one is better than the last. I highly recommend this shop to anyone looking for an amazing swim suit
3738,Great swimsuit! Very nice quality and very quick and responsive. Will use this Jennifer again.
3739,Unique style and perfectly lined...Thank you Jennifer!
3740,This is the most beautiful bikini I have ever seen let alone owned! I purchased it for my honeymoon and I am truly in love. The sequined lace is so perfect and mimics my wedding dress which creates such a romantic vibe about it. Very well made and customer service was perfect! They did a custom sizing for me on the bottom which was EXACTLY what I wanted! Could not be happier and I am so excited to wear it!!!
3741,Fast Delivery! I loved wearing this suit for my bachelorette party in Vegas. So beautiful!!
3742,This bathing suit is so beautiful! So well made and perfect for your honey moon! Thanks so much!
3743,AMAZING!!!!!!!! however the material is alot thicker than i thought but oh so beautiful!!!
3744,Gorgeous!
3745,This Bridal Bikini is just beautiful!! I purchased this for my soon to be Daughter-In-Law and can't wait to give it to her! Beautiful work :)
3746,Omg it's so beautiful!!!! 😍❤ AND comfty!
3747,Beautiful and great. Had a few hiccups. But seller was excellent. Thank you so much. Would buy from again. And would recommend. :-)
3748,"The bikini fit perfectly and is durably made! Very very pleased with this, I can't wait to wear it on our honeymoon!"
3749,"Loveeeee it!!!! Just perfect. Can’t wait to wear it on our destination wedding. 

Thank you!"
3750,Very nice suit... so pretty.
3751,Love it! Beautifully made and quick shipping.
3752,Super easy to contact! Item came quickly after purchase!
3753,***GORGEOUS*** Cant wait to wear and snap a picture!!
3754,Can’t wait to give it to my sister for her bachelorette
3755,"First of all, owner said it would ship in 1-3 business days, never did. Almost 3 weeks later, I contacted the owner and asked why I haven't received it and she said because she was sick. So she just never sent it. After telling her I wanted it for that weekend, she said she would overnight it to the hotel I was staying at for vacation. (which was in the same city she lives in). And the hotel never got a package. The tracking info doesn't work. Then, after not receiving it, I asked again and she never replied to me. So, still haven't received it and don't know if I even am ever going to receive it. Terrible experience."
3756,Just received my top today and I love it. It is a perfect fit. I received it in less than a week. Can't wait to receive my bottom piece and wear it this summer.
3757,Beautifully made. Awesome fabric. Really pretty.
3758,"I really like this top - it has one tie in the back which is nice, and it's unlike anything that I've seen in stores. Only downside is that it is a little big!"
3759,Thank you so much! It fits PERFECTLY! I will probably be ordering another soon!
3760,Love this!! Fit perfectly and shipped fast!
3761,"Great fit, nice support and it shipped fairly quickly! :)"
3762,"Very sexy suit, love it! Only issue is that I usually wear a medium and these were tight for a medium. So go larger not smaller if you question the size."
3763,Very sexy bikini!!!  I'm pretty sure its going to be see through when it gets wet (especially in the back) but its extremely comfortable to wear and love the bottoms the most. very sexy! I'm excited to wear it on my honeymoon
3764,Great quality! Runs smaller than most swimwear order a size up and you will be happy!
3765,Shipped super fast and fits really well! Super sexy little bikini!
3766,"I am so fond of this swimsuit! The fit and cut are fantastic, it is lined, and the fabric is proper quality. Worth the purchase!"
3767,Super cute and fits perfectly!
3768,"I love it! Thank you,"
3769,Very glad I bought this item! Perfect fit and friendly communication. Will order again :)
3770,"Beautiful and well made piece, Anthony was so helpful, would buy from him again"
3771,Great quality!
3772,Thank you.
3773,This was a gift for someone and she loves it. Considering ordering one for myself!
3774,This is such a comfy top. I love it!
3775,"Great material, style and fit!"
3776,"I am so in love with this bikini! I was so impressed with how beautiful and solidly made this bikini was. Olga was so prompt with communication and attentative, and everything fit perfectly the moment I got my bikini! She even put in padded bikini cups, which were greatly appreciated. All in all, quality of the bikini and the responsiveness of the seller were impressive!! I'm looking forward to ordering more suits from here!"
3777,"This is the most beautiful suit I’ve seen 😍 I can’t wait to rock it out on competition day! 
Thanks so much!!’"
3778,This suit fits perfectly like it was made exclusively for me! I sent her my measurements and she worked her magic. I can't wait to wear it for my show and I will definitely order again!
3779,"Customer service excellent, excellent product"
3780,"The loveliest, highest quality swimsuit I own! It's so comfortable and makes me feel confident in my own skin. It took a little while to arrive (From Bulgaria to the US), but you can just tell that it was thoughtfully made with care. Thank you, 05 Studio!"
3781,Top fits perfectly! Could definitely use it as a bra as well. Very comfortable.
3782,"very fast shipping and all as described, love my pieces so much! thank you!"
3783,"Thank you so much, very fast shipping and very beautifully made!"
3784,"So kind. Took a thought and hemmed the bottoms of this swim suit for me, free of cost. Appreciate your service"
3785,The small is really small!!!
3786,Absolutely love the bikini top!! Will definitely be buying more💕
3787,"I am completely in love with this swimsuit! It's absolutely gorgeous! It fits perfectly, is super comfortable to wear& looks fantastic! I really love the style of this swimsuit. Beautifully made! Shipping was very quick. I'm extremely happy with this and I highly recommend this shop. Love it! Really this is super lovely. Thank you :)"
3788,"Crazy comfortable, fits beautifully, soft material. I was excited because it looks like a TARDIS, but it's even better looking in person. I can't wait for summer =)"
3789,The tardis swimsuit exceeded every expectation.  I'm really very difficult to fit (34G and size 12) I NEVER find swim tops to fit.  She custom made it to fit me and I couldn't be happier.  I've already bookmarked a few other items I want now.  :-) Now it's to pool! Geronimo!
3790,"I love this so much, I'm not even sure where to start! The shipping was quick, and packed in a sturdy box. The suit fits perfectly, which is difficult to achieve for me as I've got some pretty tall and small things going on. The straps are really sturdy and thick so it won't just come untied and reveal the whole story to the world, and the lining is also thick which will keep the suit from going all x-rated after a dip. I am literally never buying a swimsuit from anyone else, ever again.  :)"
3791,I adore this suit!  It fits me really nicely and I feel like I look good in it.  The material and work is quality.  Plus... it's a TARDIS suit!
3792,I love it.  It fits perfectly and is simply amazing!
3793,Absolutely love it!!! Looks wonderful on
3794,"Love it! Top runs a bit large and the front panel is a bit baggy, so I would recommend buyers go down a size for the top unless you wear full coverage cup (I'm a demi cup). Bottom size is spot on. All in all, this is a very well made suit, and really cute!"
3795,"I love the shape and my husband loves the Tardis.
The whole process was very quick, and there was good communication between myself and the seller.
The only thing I would suggest is in the measurements, also include your torso length.  My suit is a bit long, but it is fixable.
Such a unique piece."
3796,"This is beautiful! There is a little too much fabric in the torso section because I'm so short, but other than that it is perfect! Most definitely the most comfortable and best looking swimsuit I've ever owned. I'll be purchasing all future swimsuits from this store as well!"
3797,Got it just in time for the Comic Con! Thanks for the quick delivery! I love love love it!
3798,Love this suit!  I've gotten tons of complements and asked several times where I bought it.
3799,"Love this swimsuit, looks amazing, really comfortable and very well made. Thank you!"
3800,Great communication and shipped in good time. Love the item looks just like the photo.
3801,Thank you so much!
3802,i love it thank you so much for fast fast service              .
3803,"Excellent quality, great communication.  Love it!"
3804,"Shipped great, girlfriend loves it :)"
3805,Awesome. I am thrilled with the quality. I can't wait to wear it!
3806,Amazing detail. My wife can't wait to wear it.
3807,"Absolutely obsessed with my bodysuit! Fits like a dream, fast delivery, everything is perfect. Can’t wait to rock this at edc lv!"
3808,"Absolutely loved it!!! So comfy, fit just the right way, and received sooo many compliments on it❤️"
3809,incredible pattern and i got to wear it to mexico
3810,"Not only was this the most flattering suit I’ve ever worn, the customer service I received was amazing. After purchasing I was asked my sizing to confirm this piece would fit me perfectly, AND IT DID! I got so many complements too!"
3811,love it love the fit and the trippy patern
3812,"Well-made, fast shipping, already dreaming of shaking it in this piece come summer tour."
3813,This is so cool! Thank you!!
3814,Awesome swimsuit fits super well love the pattern very nice A+ !
3815,suit was beautiful and seller was great communicator & helpful
3816,"Really cute, it is tighter than it looks on the top part"
3817,I was so impressed with this swimsuit! I got an extra large because I am uncomfortable with tight linings. It fits perfectly! I’m 5’7” and 180 pounds. I haven’t felt pretty in a suit in a long time. I ordered two more the same night I received the first. Thank you!!!!!!!
3818,"While I haven't officially worn it (saving it for my honeymoon in August), I did try it on and it fit perfectly! The fabric is so soft and I love the colors! I was so nervous buying a bathing suit on Etsy especially a one piece since I have a hard time finding ones that fit correctly, but this one did and I am so happy!"
3819,"Beautiful!! Buy it! For reference, I'm pear-shaped — 5'5, 135lbs and between an A and B cup. I went for the medium and it fits well. There is a bit of room if you are bigger than me, too. The seller was incredibly responsive and all-around lovely!"
3820,"OMG it's stunning! I wasn't sure this style would me. I'm 5'7"", small boobs, juicy bum. I was worried it would make me look bottom-heavy. But I chanced it and it TOTALLY paid off. It's completely gorgeous. The high waist is really flattering. If you're a bottom-heavy woman, go for it. I also got my sister to try it on. She's 5'4"", same body shape. She adores it too and was *very* sceptical! PLUS it's beautifully made from quality, soft material and comes carefully packaged with a lovely note from the maker. I put this on just to feel good. Looking at the bikinis now too ..."
3821,"My item came incredibly quick!, the suit itself is the MOST softest material I have ever felt and it was so comfortable to wear.
The colour and pattern is exactly what it looks like and I am loving it!!!!. All my friends will be making a purchase very soon as they are incredibly jealous to have one.
Thank you so much!!! Xxx"
3822,"The fabric is soft, the pattern is beautiful, and the edges don't squeeze you as much as a regular swimsuit, so you're not getting smooshed out the sides. The only thing that was a bit of an issue for me is the fit. I'm small on top and large on bottom (normally 36B top and size 8 bottom), so maybe I should have done custom measurements- I went with a large suit. The fit was an issue when it was windy, because I had to tie the straps tighter to keep from having the suit top fly up and flash everyone :) But when I tied the straps tighter, then the bottom rode up a bit and the waist didn't sit quite right, and I felt like I was pulling the bottom out of my bum a lot. But when it wasn't so windy out, and I could have the straps a bit looser, everything fit comfortably and stayed covered :)"
3823,Love love LOVE this suit! It’s a perfect fit and I love that I was able to contact the shop owner to get a recommendation on which size I should go with. I got the small. I am 5’5” and about 125 lbs. can’t wait to wear this at the beach this summer!!
3824,"Absolutely love it! I make all my friends try on this swimsuit, and it suits them all. I feel very confident wearing it, now I added a little strap at the back to prevent it from being too sidebooby. Sexy, comfortable, classy, and made of a gorgeous fabric - I will buy this again!"
3825,"Love it, love it! I was really worried it would not look good on my shape as I am an Apple shape with a short torso but it's really flattering and comfy! The material is lovely and i am looking forward to wearing this on romantic spa weekends etc.. I have posted a photo because I found it really helpful to see other people's photo's in the reviews when i was making up my mind whether to purchase or not so hope to give that back."
3826,"Love the pattern and the quality! Doesn't fit my top half AT ALL. I looked at so many pictures, read just about all the reviews and saw other busty women wearing this suit, but for some reason it didn't fit me. I am 5'9"" 160lbs and a size 36 DDD, there is not enough fabric to cover either side of my boobs whatsoever, but the bottom half fits perfect. Sad to say I don't think I can put this swimsuit to any use this summer."
3827,"The material is a bit different and I haven't taken it in water yet to see how it performs, but it's a gorgeous swimsuit! Well made and fits really well and true to size! Warning though--it's not super secure up top so you might want some boob tape or something with it"
3828,"This swimsuit is worth every penny! The material is unlike anything I’ve ever felt- so soft and supple! I ordered a small and it’s such a great fit- I am a size A cup and there is, however, some side breast- I don’t mind this, but wanted to mention it for others! Sexy, tasteful and beautifully made"
3829,"When I first recieved the bathing suit the breast pieces were too small for me (showed side boob) so kerri happily made me a custom. The process was quick and easy.
Absolutely love the suit!"
3830,I absolutely LOVE my new suit! I'm usually very cautious about ordering suits online but I just couldn't stop thinking about this suit so I just went for it and bought and I'm so glad that I did because it is gorgeous. My most favorite suit I've ever had and I live in FL so I've had a lot of suits! Lol
3831,This is a beautiful swimsuit. The material is so soft and pretty and it is really well made. I'm 5'6 about 125 lbs and the small fits perfectly. I love it.
3832,I couldn’t be happier with my suit. The shop was more than accommodating to my specific needs and allowed me to send in measurements. She made me a custom suit to fit my body. Thank you a million times for making my personal imperfections seem meaningless. #happycustomer
3833,The suit came in much quicker then the delivery date suggested. I am in love with it and it fits wonderfully! I have received so many compliments.
3834,"My swimsuit is absolutely perfect! Classy, sexy, fits perfectly! Thank you so much!"
3835,"Wow, what an amazing bathing suit! I feel like a Goddess in it! I'm still not confident enough to lean forward without the fear of my boobs coming out, so I might add a snap button or a transparent band. Also, the fabric is worth noticing - it's soooo soft and really high quality! Can't wait to get on the beach XOXO"
3836,LOVE! Kerry's bikinis are really beautiful and reasonably priced for such good quality. I have two :)
3837,"This swimsuit is so soft and lovely.  I've gotten so many compliments on it, thank you so much!  Really really happy with this purchase."
3838,"This suit is beautiful. So soft and customer service is 100%!! I am 5’5 & 138lbs(about 63kg) and B bust...and I got a medium but the suit was too big. Which Is my fault and a risk you take ordering online. But small chested girls consider sizing down if you can for bottom too. 

And Kerry was so nice and did extra work on the suit and even offered an exchange! She’s amazing. 
I’ll probably just give this one to my sister and order another when I can. Haha such a wonderful experience working with someone who cares so much about her business. 
Thank you!!"
3839,I LOVE this piece. Super soft and flattering and I'm such a fan. Also shop owner was responsive and found an extra size small laying around even though she as technically out of stock 😍😘
3840,"Das Muster/Motiv ,der Stoff sind wunderschön und einzigartig. Aber der Schnitt... ich bin 1,75 m groß trage eine XS/ S und habe eine 75E . Meine Brüste haben gar keinen Halt, sie rutschen ständig heraus, sodass ich nur an mir herumzupfe...das macht keinen Spaß und ist nervig. Bitte entwirf einen Badeanzug mit Halt für große Brüste, diesen werde ich kaufen."
3841,Love love love this bathing suit ! I have been wanting to buy a suit from this shops for over year. Finally did it and I am not disappointed in the least . Soft beautiful fabric is used for their suits. I will definitely be back to buy another 🤗
3842,Kerri was amazing!! I hate bathing suit shopping cause im a human woman. I have big boobs and a smaller waist so I either find ones too small or too old lady like. Kerri custom made this to my measurements. It’s the best suit i I ever owned!
3843,Adore this swimsuit! Super flattering and comfortable :) honestly can’t wait to have some extra cash so I can order one in another color!!
3844,"GORGEOUS suit. I will have to post photos when it gets warmer out. I love the fit, soft material and design. The shoppe owner responded right away and gave me great advice regarding sizing. I will definitely order here again!"
3845,"This swimsuit is gorgeous, the fabric is so nice and soft. I feel very comfortable wearing it, it is very flattering. The delivery and communication was quick and pleasant. Thank you for a great shopping experience. :)"
3846,The swimsuit is adorable and the shipping/receiving was super fast!
3847,Love the look of this and the feel of the material! As a smallish woman with a bigger bust I got a small thinking it would fit my body but let it be known this is probably going to be a little easier/ more practical if you have smaller knockers. Its super gorgeous though! I still will wear it just for shorter amounts of time.
3848,The swimsuits look amazing! Looks exactly like what I saw on your site. Also fits to size. I definitely will buy more in the future. Thanks again 😉
3849,Thank you so much!!!  LOVE my suit :) <3
3850,Absolutely in love with this suit!! I was a little hesitant about the coverage but it covers everything perfectly and it is the most comfortable suit I have ever bought! Kerry is amazing and really went above and beyond to help me choose a size. Will be ordering another!!
3851,Awesome quality and just gorgeous!!!!   So impressed with this shop.   Ordered 4 (2 different styles) and they all are perfect fit :-)
3852,Love it! This is my third suit and I always get compliments ❤️
3853,"Love it. Still haven't worn it, but i tried it on, and it fits nicely! Kerry is amazing."
3854,I get so many compliments  on this swimsuit. Fits perfectly and I love the material. ❤️ I will be ordering another one in a different color.
3855,"Gorgeous, as always!"
3856,"Gorgeous, well made swimsuit! Thank you for making me very happy!"
3857,Such a beautiful item. Felt so confident when wearing this :)
3858,Beautiful suit. It fits perfectly and the fabric is amazing and comfy!
3859,Beautiful !
3860,Fabulous as always.
3861,I absolutely love this bathing suit! Its stunning! Just don't wear it on a beach with lots of waves...your boobies might escape! But that's common sense I guess! Love it sooooo much!
3862,Amazingly cute and comfy! Highly recommend. :3
3863,"AMAZING bathing suit; well-made and beautiful. I'm not sure I'll be purchasing another swimsuit anywhere else, this is a high standard, thanks!"
3864,Excellent quality & perfect fit! Pictures don’t do it justice. Thank you!
3865,"It's very soft and high quality but unfortunately didn't suit (pun intended) my body type. I have small breasts but an otherwise curvy figure (and I'm 5'5). Feels like I don't have enough breast to actually keep the 'straps' from moving around, so as of right now, I'm too scared that I'll be flashing someone if I wear it to the beach! I may have to do some DIY tailoring. It's a beautiful item, though."
3866,Love it! Super cute with a hint of sexy
3867,"Beautiful swimsuit and well made.  The back (between the top of the suit and the top of my butt) bags a little but I think it’s because I’m very thin, I think it would fit most people better.  I still plan to wear it and think it will be fine when swimming.  :)"
3868,"didn't fit well or look good on me, easy return, thank you!"
3869,"Such a cute swimsuit, can't wait to wear it this summer!"
3870,"love it, high quality and fast shipping!"
3871,"It fits, but I was expecting it to be swimsuit material."
3872,I just received this bathing suit in the mail and I am IN LOVE!!! Fits true to size. Awesome for anyone with larger boobs. It just rocks all around. VERY pleased with my purchase!!!
3873,perfection!!!! so amazing and the size is perfect. total bargain for the quality!!! the best!
3874,"fabric is amazing! stretchy and perfect for swimming 

love the design and quality! total bargain 

only thing I would
love is lining in the bottoms but not too fussed 

such a happy customer"
3875,"So lovely, they are exactly like the picture! Thanks so much"
3876,"Ever since I was 7 years old (40 years ago), I wanted to be Wonder Woman.  This suit reminds me of that childhood dream.  Every aspect from order to delivery was spot on.  Excellent communication.  It fits perfectly to my measurements, which are on the extra large side, and she changed the straps for me as a special request.  I ordered it on Sunday evening and I received it in CA on Friday.  I can't wait to jump in the pool!"
3877,"I Purchased custom made Wonder Woman 1 piece on Oct. 17,  
Christy altered the design for me at my request, and with her superior Fashion Sense it turned out looking perfect, as well as fitting like a glove, all that and she shipped it out so I got it before Halloween. 
   Christy is an Artist, you won't be disappointed buying from Kooj."
3878,"I can honestly say I not only love the swimsuit (as well as several compliments I have received from multiple people) I also really appreciated its creator.

She was very open to suggestions with my requested needs for the swimsuit in regards to my unique shape.  As a result it fits like a fashionable glove.

My only criticism...she needs to create more character suites!!!"
3879,AMAZING quality! She payed attention to every little detail I asked for and was super sweet about it all. It's too cute for words and fits like a dream. I will be shopping with her again in the future for sure! :]
3880,You guys are awesome ^_^ I love this Wonder Women Bathing Suit and the matching skirt for it and plus it fits perfectly I love it ^_^ Thank you so much
3881,"I was SO pleased with my swimsuit when I received it. I am VERY VERY picky when it comes to the fit of my clothing. And Christy really helpful with measurements! I was worried that my bust (38D) was going to be hard to fit...but when I got it and put it on, it was a perfect fit for me. I ordered my suit June 30th and I received it in about a week! Which is faster than anything I've ever bought! She did a wonderful job with tailoring and construction too! If you're looking for something custom made to fit your body how you like...buy from Kooj! (: Below I will attach a photo of my swimsuit!"
3882,"I am amazed at how great this suit is! I was somewhat nervous to buy a handmade suit, but the quality is impeccable. She was very nice and replied to me almost immediately. I have my exact measurements and the suit fits like a glove. I don't want to take it off! Thanks a million, I will be purchasing from you again."
3883,"The shipment was extraordinarily speedy (which was brilliant). But the suit, god words cannot describe how beautiful it is!! I bought it so I could have a nice suit to snorkle in while in Fiji & New Zealand this semester and I am so excited to show off this piece of art! It's so much more than I expected. The inner-WW in me will shine brightly!."
3884,"I LOVE my Wonder Woman swimsuit! High-quality construction, perfect fit--I've gotten tons of compliments on it already. I have a hard time finding swimsuits that fit me well and this one is gorgeous. Plus, it shipped extremely fast. I'd definitely order from this shop again."
3885,"amazingly constructed, high quality, super flattering!!! can't wait for summer!!!!"
3886,"Absolutely LOVE my suit! The fabric appears to be sturdy and of high quality..... Kooj Custom made it to my measurements and when I made a special requests regarding the straps, I was accomodated without question... Thanks a bunch!"
3887,"The swimsuit came super fast and is super cute. It fits like a glove which is impressive, I'm 5ft 6 and 102 pounds so usually everything is too big, I am so glad it fit! Thank you for such a lovely swimsuit I recommend this shop to anyone who want s a cute suit with a perfect fit!"
3888,She was great about personalizing it just for me and let me know when the sewing machine went down! Love it and my friends are completely jealous! Thanks so much!
3889,"This is an amazing swimsuit! And the stitching is incredible for a handmade item! I love it, and I can't wait to take it on vacation with me! Thank you so much for the fast shipping as well! So many exclamation points! :)"
3890,"Don't wear this suit if you have a problem with getting lots of attention! I debuted it on the beaches of Fort Lauderdale and Miami and it was a hit! Beyond that, the suit is very well made. I also have a longer torso, so normally one pieces don't work for me. But I sent my measurements and the suit fit me like a glove. LOVE IT!"
3891,"I am so in love with this bathing suit. I was worried about the fit but it's incredibly perfect. It is snug in all the right places without being too tight, the colors are brilliant, the quality is just magnificent. It arrived much faster than I thought it would, too. Amazing purchase overall."
3892,"best swimsuit !!! I love everything about this, style, color and I love being Wonder Woman when I go swimming !!"
3893,"I cannot believe how great this thing looks on. I'm a bigger gal and was really hesitant to order online and trust that someone would actually tailor a suit to fit me but Kooj did an amazing job! I feel totally confident even at my size to wear this around. It fits perfectly and I was surprised at how fast the shipping was.

3894,The wonder woman bathing suit fits perfect. I sent my exact measurements to the seller and it fits perfect. I am pear shaped so larger around my hips and upper thigh. That being said the elastic around the legs was a little tight but nothing painful. The suit still fits well.
3895,Omg! love love love this swimsuit & skirt. It came in a few days and it fits perfectly! Thank you sooo much! The best! I will place more orders from you in the near future. Love your work! Thanks again!!
3896,"Thank you so

3899,"Soooo cute. Stocked the delivery online and could not wait until I got it. When I did I tried it on immediately and it is soooo darling. I cannot wait to go on vacation and use it. 
Being a mom it covers all the right places, is still flattering, and it fits like a glove. 
This is my second swimsuit and I recommend any of these suits if you are looking for something flattering, cute,and stylish all at the same time.
Definitely be buying from her again when I'm ready for a new suit. 
Soooo excited."

3923,"Thank you.  Nice suit, ,,,fun to wear."
3924,"Received it fairly quickly and overall I like it, but it's very unflattering around my thighs as it's tight in that area, and a little longer in the abdomen than expected."
3925,Looks just as the picture.  Looking forward to wearing it.
3926,"I never got my order. I contacted the shop about this, but got no reply from them. 
Should I assume my money is lost? I really like shopping on Etsy, and want to believe this is a shop problem and not a website problem.
Sorry, I am just disappointed by the lack of response :("
3927,I love my new bathing suit ! I purchased the American flag top for the Fourth of July and received so many compliments. The best part is that I received it in 2 days ! Bstyle is awesome.
3928,"The seller was really great for getting it to me on time, and when I asked about sizing she hit it spot on. I was really sastified with this item."
3929,bstyle was very easy to get in communication with and the product shipped quickly. The top is well-made and perfect for festival season. I also love the fact that it has built-in padding!
3930,Such an awesome custom made top! Fit perfectly and I had so many compliments on our annual Independence Day Lake trip!!
3931,I love this top. Looks just like the picture except my stripes were going vertical not horizontal but no big deal. It's still just as cute. The seller is VERY quick to respond to any messages and help out. Definitely ordering from her again.
3932,Amazing!!!!! Love love love love
3933,Awesome very cute!!!! Shipping just as described!

3940,It was on its way within hours. Thanks!
3941,Lucy was SOOOO sweet and the custom bathing suit was beautiful and better than store bought. Top line! A++++++
3942,"Im pretty tall (5’10”) so one piece suits tend to either ride high or low on me. This bathing suit is amazing though! 10/10 would buy again!!!! Great quality, nice textured fabric, lots of straps for adjustments as needed!"
3943,"Loved this suit , she made it to fit my body perfectly. The only thing I would change is not to have the ruffles hang so low . Other than that it is so cute . Will order again . Thank you !"
3944,This swimsuit is beautiful and fits perfectly! I love that it is adjustable and is very well made! Thank you so much!
3945,"Absolutely gorgeous, I'll send you a shot of Angel wearing it as soon as it warms up enough for the beach!"
3946,Love it! Thank you LoveLucyBea for great communication and fast shipping. I received so many compliments on this super cute suit!
3947,"Love this bathing suit, made to fit my body perfectly. Can't wait to buy the wine color. Fast delivery!!! Even can accommodate emergency situations... Great customer service and will answer a question in a timely manner. Great shop and Great designer... I received so many stares and compliments with this bathing suit. Ladies if you want to hide that little bulge on your tummy while you work on it.. This is the perfect bathing suit to feel completely confident and sexy.... BUY NOW!!! You won't be disappointed.."
3948,"Nice suit, quick delivery, good service and a perfect fit (I was nervous about what I'd get based off emailed measurements). The color looks like more of a bright pink to me than what I'd consider coral, but I'm still keeping it. Overall quite satisfied."
3949,I love the material and the bathing suits.  They fit so great.   Thanks
3950,"The wife loves it, amazing quality."
3951,"Perfect! It fits so well and looks good on all sorts of body types, including mine. I asked for the abdomen to be slightly shorter since I'm short, and it came out perfect. I also asked for it to have a slit in the side of the bust to insert padding if I wanted, but there's an extra layer of cloth to help with shape and support without being a bra. The straps are wider than usual, so they're comfortable. I love it. The only problem is that the material under the bust stretches when you tie it, and the lettering there starts to crack apart from it. Other than that tiny detail, awesome!"
3952,"I love it! I ordered this style monokini but requested it to be Wonder Woman themed. It came out fantastic and fits perfectly! Thank you so much Lisa! I usually can't wear monokinis because they aren't long enough for my torso, but you did it!!! <3"
3953,This bathing suit fits perfectly! I'm very happy with the item. I'm 5'11 and a size 10-12 and she made this fit! The rouched bottom is so flattering. Can't wait to place my next order!
3954,"There was a bit of a mix up but the seller was so easy to work with that I have no complaints. The swimsuit is both geeky and super sexy! I love it so much that im going to order the Wonder Woman one piece today. I hope there will be more monokinis, these are so flattering!"
3955,The swim suit was beautifully made and makes my whovian hearts ecstatic!
3956,A great fit and great quality!  I purchased this for a special event this summer and it is exactly what I expected!!!
3957,Love this bathing suit! Fits amazing and it is very well made!! Thank you so much ♡
3958,YAAAAAAAAAAAASSSS!!! I LOVE THE SHIT OUT OF THIS THING!!!!
3959,"Fits wonderfully, I love it! Thank you so much!"
3960,"I bought as a surprise for my boyfriend(now fiancé.) for our first ""long"" vacation together. we have done many weekend trips but this was his first cruise. Fit perfectly and he loved it!!!"
3961,"Fit great and hugged in all the right places, was good quality and shipping was pretty quick"
3962,This is my favorite bathing suit I've ever owned. Specifically it fits in the back side better than anything I've ever been able to find in a store and the stitching is fantastic. Love love love
3963,"My wife ordered the Tardis monokini and she loves it! It fits perfectly and is incredibly well made. I personally love it more than she does, cuz she looks super hot in it. So from BOTH of us ( but especially me ) thank you very much!"

3978,Super cute! Exactly what I wanted.
3979,I love this swimsuit! It fits perfectly. the seller even reached out to get my measurements. This is by far my favorite swimsuit and the cheetah print is so fun!
3980,"Super cute and unique one piece! Seller was SO incredibly accommodating and made and shipped the suit to me before I left on vacation. Fabric and construction were very good, high quality. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the suit was fairly short in the torso, even after I provided my exact measurements. I kept it though because I really wanted to wear on vacay and didn't have enough time to exchange. It worked and I did get compliments. :)"
3981,The quality is outstanding! I love this swimsuit from The Velvet Party! It arrived super quick! Love her work! :)
3982,"Absolutely love this cat suit! I ordered a small and it fits perfect! It is both comfortable and sexy, great purchase."
3983,"I am absolutely in love with this bathing suit. I am a curvy girl and it is so flattering. The seller was very quick, friendly and helpful. Thanks a million!"
3984,"This suit is beautiful. It is thinner than I expected so I’ve been wearing it under my overalls or with a pair of high waisted jeans as a body suit. I actually love it more as a body suit than a swimsuit!
It’s really soft and the colors are gorgeous! The shop owner was really sweet and accommodating and the shipping was fast."
3985,"Absolutely love this suit, it's great quality and fits perfectly."
3986,Amazing suit! Cut beautifully and so flatteringly; awesome classic leopard print; shipped lightning fast; seller was amicable and speedy with a size exchange! So pleased! Will be back!

Thanks again!"
4002,I loved this swimsuit! It came earlier then I expected and it looks amazing. The quality of the swimsuit makes it clear that it will last for a very long time. I highly recommend this seller and will be buying again for next summer's look.
4003,👍👍👍

If your on the fence about ordering,DO IT!"
4005,"This suit is BEAUTIFUL!  I was apprehensive about ordering online since I can rarely find bathing suits that fit when I try them on in the store.  This suit fit me like a glove, and is made SO WELL.  No detail was overlooked.  Shop owner is also extremely attentive and willing to work with you.  I love how you can send measurements and get the perfect suit for your body.  I'll probably end up buying all of my suits from Kooj!"

4017,"Such beautiful, eco-conscious craftsmanship! The Organic Cotton fabric is so soft against my skin and when I put it on I can feel all of the love that was put into each stitch. The seller was so kind and genuine and I can tell they really care about what they are sending out into the world 💗 I also have to note that I have a reasonably large chest and the M/L fits me like a glove with plenty of support for my ladies! Thank you PrimitiveTribalCraft I look forward to getting some more of your sweet threads in the future!"

4025,Very helpful seller in every way. Great quality bikini it seems. Awesome everything! I'm happy!

4029,"Fast shipping, Beautiful bikini pieces"
4030,bikini lies nicely and the material is pleasant and slightly elastic :)
4031,Very comfortable and beautiful... thank you!
4032,Had high hopes but then noticed a small hole on right bikini triangle. Unsure if it was used or a moth got into the warehouse....Disappointed
4033,Fits perfect! Absolutely love it ! And the owner is a pleasure to work with. Definitely going to be ordering more!!
4034,ABSOLUTELY LOVE ITTTTT :D
4035,Amazing item! Well made   with quality fabric. Extremely fast shipping. I can't wait to wear on my honeymoon! Thank you!
4036,I absolutely love the two pairs of bottoms I ordered! Fit perfect and look great!
4037,"Exactly as described/shown.  Seller was very helpful at determining size.  I was hesitant to order an XS because I'm usually a size 4 in pants, but I'm glad I did!  I'll definitely be ordering again, thanks!"
4038,It fits my wife good just wasn't what she expected
4039,Beautiful suit! I wore this to a 1940's theme pool party. It's such nice quality and print. My new fave!
4040,Amazing look. Love the wideness of the straps. It definitely holds and hides my post pregnancy roll! Will purchase again no doubt. Thank you for being such a creative human!
4041,"Absolutely surprised with quality of the suit! Fabric is great and the elastic for the highwaisted shorts fits very comfortably not too tight and not lose. The elastic is by far what I was most pleased with as this area in most suits tends to cut your figure and squeeze you hips and love handle area. LOVE THAT ABOUT THESE SUITS THEY WILL NOT SO THAT! I WILL BE PLACING MULTIPLE ORDERS IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE!
Incredible personable communication with seller and very quick shipping for say myself who lives in Toronto, Ontario Canada! 

Cheers hope this helps future customers you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!

4042,"This suit fits absolutely perfectly and the pattern is wonderful. I love it, no complaints at all. ♡"
4043,"This is more lovely than I thought, Thank you so much!"
4044,So beautiful! The material is great quality and was delivered on time.
4045,Cute. I am satisfied with the quality and the seller communication.
4046,Great fit and feel. Thank You
4047,Great quality and beautiful and unique!
4048,Love love love! Great bathing suit. I typically buy vitamin a and Vix suits but I was so happy with this bathing suit. The rainbow pattern is great and the fit is awesome! Shipping was good :)
4049,I knew it was love at first sight. I just knew it. It was shipped fast and fits amazingly!!! I'm in love and can't wait to order more!!
4050,"Very nice fabric and looks just like the picture. Top was too big, so they're sending me a smaller size. My tits are 34C-D, and it was kinda big cup wise. It does make you look wide, like wider than you are, but all stripes, checker print, poke a dots, etc will do that to you. Really nice bikini. 
It wouldn't let me upload a picture that wasn't square, so I had to put it on a black background. 
YES GUYS IM MARRIED. but also into hot blondes"
4051,"I needed a rainbow bikini for my job for San Diego PRIDE and Hunny Bunny did not disappoint. In fact, all the gay children (men & women were losing their minds over the derrière. I believe that is 100% thanks to the adorable scrunch Brazilian bottoms. It is definitely low cut in the front but I was expecting that. Pleased with the quality fast shipping and communication. Can't recommend enough!!"
4052,absolutely my fave purchase! was soo worried about delivery and it got here 2 days earlier!!!!!!! thank you!!!!!!!
4053,"This was actually a custom order and not the bikinis that are listed. Hunni is like a super hero. She managed to create exactly what I had in mind for the holidays and get them shipped to me in 3 days over Thanksgiving. I only needed them by Christmas, but hey, she got them delivered in 3 days after finalizing the design. And what works of art they are!! I can't say enough good things about this shop or their merchandise! Thank you Hunni :)"
4054,I totally feel like Rainbow Dash in this
4055,I absolutely love this bikini. Well made and fits perfectly.
4056,"Even though the bikini didn’t fit the way I wanted, the return and refund were quick and easy. Thank you!!! A+++"
4057,Incredibly Hott! May never make it to the beach!
4058,"Just like the pictures!!! Honestly my dream
bathing suit"
4059,The bathing suit was super cute but the bottoms were SUPER SMALL! I had to return it because I didn't want to look like a plumber! Super sad because it looked great otherwise!
4060,"I like it a lot. I workout, so my body is thin but I have a quite shapely bum. It's where I gain muscle most easily. My only problem with this bikini (which I do love) is that the bottoms were said to fit around 43 inches at most, which happens to be my ""hip"" measurement. It might be a little too small for me. I might have liked a little more fabric for my body type. Otherwise, totally cute. Very fast shipping."
4061,"Just as cute as pictured! The customer service is amazing, too."
4062,This bikini is so bright and fun. Well made and true to size. I can't wait to wear it!
4063,"I dont have a photo, cause i did have to return the product i orded to small of a size. But the service and return was absolutly wonderful!!"
4064,Did really fit right.
4065,Awesome suit! Fast shipping and seller was very responsive!
4066,"It's an extremely cute bikini. It fits well, and looks great!"
4067,"Made nicely, fits nicely. Shipped on time"
4068,"looks exactly like photo, shipped promptly!"
4069,"Nice work, looks awesome on my fiancee!"
4070,Great quality material.
4071,"Cute print. Colors are exactly as they appear in pics. However, Sizing is off. The bottoms run super small! I'm a 4-6 normally and I should have gotten a LARGE. Also the fabric is very thin. Not the best quality.  I was a little disappointed."
4072,I am SO happy with this swimsuit! I made sure to measure my body correctly and asked the seller if she could give me a M top and a L bottom. She responded right away  and said yes! She is so friendly and great to work with. The swimsuit feels custom made it fits like a glove. I’m self conscious about my thighs so I love the little extra fabric that covers them up just a little to give me confidence. Thank you so much!
4073,I had to take it in myself a bit on the bottoms. My bust is DD and my hips small.
4074,Great suit.  Great price.  Seller with good communication.  And she was willing to do what it took for the suit to fit me well.
4075,I freakin love it!!!
4076,"The material is great quality (I asked for 'Make in the States'), it fits perfectly and looks great. I haven't tested it out in the water yet though. And there is a slight sag in the frontal crotch region....but overall delighted with it"
4077,"This suit is super cute! I was worried about purchasing a swimsuit online, but this shop is great quality. It also got to me only 8 days after I bought it."
4078,Absolutely perfect!! Fast shipping and the bathing suit fit perfectly!! Definitely will be buying another one!! Thank you so much for your great work ❤️
4079,The swimsuit fits perfect and came super fast! I ordered it Friday and it got there on Monday! I absolutely love it! I’ll be ordering another one later. Thank you so much!!! ❤️❤️
4080,"I love this suit! But I forgot that swimsuits get a little bigger/looser when wet. I was on the fence about ordering a M or L, and I went for the L, but it gets a little loose in the water, especially the top. But it's not too bad, so I am still very happy with my purchase."
4081,"I got so many compliments on this suit and it is seriously so completely gorgeous. I'm only giving it 4 stars though because the first time I wore it I noticed the bottoms had a small hole along one of the edges where the red fabric (only about the size of a nickle) was not there and it was showing the tan waterproof layer underneath. The top also had an issue where the tan waterproof layer would fold over a bit and show as well.
Even with those issues I would still buy again!"
4082,I absolutely love this suit!
4083,"Thank you for responding to my several conversations before I ordered this swim suit from you!  You sent it out to me quickly, knowing I was needing it before going on vacation.  I appreciate you doing that for me.  It is made of good quality and is lined, which I like.  I am bigger up top than on the bottom, so I ended up going with a large, so the bottoms where too big, but I wore them anyway.  I wish you had where you could order different sizes for the top and bottoms, but other than that, I loved it!  Thanks again for a good product and great service!  Mrs. T"
4084,Literally perfect fit. Awesome awesome job!!!!!!!!
4085,"Oh my gosh!  I love this suit, thanks so much!"
4086,Ordered a medium top & bottom. Top was a little loose so I mailed it back and got a small- fits much better! (there is no way to adjust it in the back) Can't wait to wear it!
4087,"I don't wear 2-pieces because of saggy skin from pregnancy, but this bikini made me feel sexy, comfortable and confident. The shipping was very fast. All in all, I love the suit and will definitely purchase another in the near future!"
4088,"4/5 just because the fit isn't perfect, but still pretty good. I'm about 5'7, 115 lbs, and an A-B cup, so I ordered the small. For me, there is a bit where the fabric up top above the breast area flaps down a little and you can see the lining, but I just tuck it in and under, and it looks fine, though have to fix it after swimming. The bottoms seem a little tight in the butt, they tend to ride up the butt like a wedgy, have to keep pulling them down over my cheeks, while at the same time, they are pretty loose and baggy in front pelvic area. I thought I had it on backwards at first, but it was the right way, it's just made for someone who has more of a belly and less of a bum than I do. It held up after a dip in a chlorine pool with no discoloration. Good fabric. Ordered June 13 and received June 24."
4089,Design was great but small size still so big.. Even after looking at size guide.  Had to get mine altered
4090,love it！
4091,Super adorable and the colour is perfect!
4092,"Amazing! Well made, looked great."
4093,awesome! Shop is fantastic! Love
4094,Very cute and well made. Seller was quick to get this to us
4095,Quick delivery and a very flattering fit!
4096,It did not fit the way I wanted it to.
4097,THe bottoms have a little too much material - would have liked them a little smaller.
4098,Very disappointed :( guess I don’t have the body type for this type of bathing suit. Even more disappointed because I’ve been trying to contact the shop about exchanging for a one piece and haven’t heard back. I had questions before I made my purchase with responses in under 24hrs but now that I want to exchange (since I can’t return) it’s “radio silence” for over a week. Very disappointed in the customer service :\
4099,Love it!  Thank you x
4100,Lovely little suit.
4101,Wow. I am very impressed. The quality of both the sewing and the design are superior on this swimsuit! I can't recommend this store enough and I also can't wait to order many more suits in the future.
4102,i adore new suit! than you so very much.
4103,amazing fit and great quality. excited to purchase more
4104,AMAZING ITEM!!! extremely fast postage
4105,Arrived in time and looks as described.   Beautiful design.   Material is a little thinner than I'd like but I know it's meant for the beach.  My kids have been stealing my sarongs which I use in the car or plane as a light blanket and shawl.  Now they'll get their own for Christmas with very cool prints!
4106,"Beautiful sarong
Great customer service 
5/5"
4107,The shipping was quick and product is amazing!
4108,Beautiful prints and I appreciated the cute extra gifts and fast shipping. Can’t wait to wear my pareo in Tahitian class. Mahalo
4109,"Great product, would buy again."
4110,"Such beautiful, eco-conscious craftsmanship! The Organic Cotton fabric is so soft against my skin and when I put it on I can feel all of the love that was put into each stitch. The seller was so kind and genuine and I can tell they really care about what they are sending out into the world 💗 I also have to note that I have a reasonably large chest and the M/L fits me like a glove with plenty of support for my ladies! Thank you PrimitiveTribalCraft I look forward to getting some more of your sweet threads in the future!"
4111,The set is well made and so beautiful! It fits perfectly. I'm so happy with my purchase! :) I will buy from this shop again for sure :)
4112,"Amazing!! Fabric quality, design, fit, all really beautiful. l definitely will keep buying more items in the future! The estimated delivery was meet with no problems.  Very nice customer service too. Thanks! :D"
4113,♥️♥️♥️
4114,"Strappy to adjust for different bodies, this is a simple, but pretty suit. Adore the pattern, material, and cut!

PrimitiveTribalCraft is responsive to inquiries and super helpful. Great sexy styles for ladies and gents."
4115,Love my new bikini so much! Thank you!
4116,My favorite bikini I've ever owned. Extremely comfortable. I actually like to work in the top. I love how it fits me!
4117,Absolutely love the way the bikini lays against the body. It is a very flattering shape and I love the material.
4118,Very helpful seller in every way. Great quality bikini it seems. Awesome everything! I'm happy!
4119,Super cute! Happy to have a underwear/bathing suit set made of natural materials finally.
4120,I love these bikinis .. thank you
4121,"Perfect, thank you so much !!"
4122,"Fast shipping, Beautiful bikini pieces"
4123,bikini lies nicely and the material is pleasant and slightly elastic :)
4124,Very comfortable and beautiful... thank you!
4125,Had high hopes but then noticed a small hole on right bikini triangle. Unsure if it was used or a moth got into the warehouse....Disappointed
4126,"The fit of this bathing suit is remarkable! I recommend her work to anyone.  Just keep in mind the bathing suit stretches when it gets wet, I had no clue about that, but it wasn't a bad stretch at all."
4127,"After waiting 10 business days after purchase I messaged seller about shipment as info says 3-5 business days. I did not receive a reply but the next day my item was shipped! I bought a medium top, it is beautifully made, but I am a C bra size US and would suggest maybe getting a large if you are as well or up a size! Can't wait to wear it."
4128,HE RECIBIDO EL PEDIDO Y ESTA PERFECTO . GRACIAS
4129,"Doesnt have any support, doesn't stretch at all, it doesn't make nice boobs as there is no support, I'm not a big fan.."
4130,"The top fits my girlfriend perfectly and looks great! Great looking item, and nice quality... thanks for working with us Lucy Bea!"
4131,Arrived exactly as advertised in a timely fashion and provided the perfect top for a July 4th photoshoot. Thanks to the shop owner!
4132,I have NEVER had a top fit me as well as this top does. I am a medium but still need a xxl in the top without being oddly shaped. This handmade suit won’t be the last I buy here.
4133,Perfect! Thank you again for a great item.
4134,No padding. But overall quality product!
4135,I love these bottoms. They are so flattering and very well made. I will never buy a swimsuit anywhere else ever again. Jennifer is so kind and answers all your questions promptly. Highly recommend this shop to everyone looking for something fun and a little different than the cookie cutter stuff from the stores
4136,"BEST BOTTOMS!! easy to adjust, long sexy side strings. seller was great! fast shipping."
4137,Perfect fit for my daughter who is impossible to fit right now!  Thank you!
4138,the BEST basic bikini bottoms to go with any suit top! Just love your bikinis!
4139,shipping didn't take too long! was a good fit
4140,The cutest 'kini I own!!
4141,Thank you so much for the great bikini bottoms
4142,Just as described! Love!
4143,My new favorite bikini bottoms!
4144,"BEST BIKINI BOTTOMS EVER! great seller, great customer service! will buy from her again!"
4145,"Exactly what I was looking for. Nice black color. Online shopping is a little different than trying on, but they knew their sizing, so going up a size like they recommended was perfect. 

The elastic is a little smaller than I am used to but seems durable enough to hold up to waves. Great for tanning or braving the ice."
4146,"Thank you JoEllen!  The measurements that you took from me and the finished product came out perfect!  Wow... I am so impressed with the workmanship and the quality of this bikini.  I do believe this is the best fitting swimsuit I've ever had!  I will definitely be ordering more.  The brown color is perfect!

The product shipped very quickly and was delivered very quickly!  

***** A+"
4147,"Definitely order a size up; I gave my measurements and was still slightly small.  Lining of the crotch ripped before even wearing it.  Other than that it's just as shown in picture, full coverage."
4148,I'm a 34C and ordered size M. Fits perfect.
4149,"LOVEEE this bikini!!! Very well made... Not flimsy material... SUPER CUTE!! Def recommend! 🇺🇸 (Will post pic soon!)
Thanks again"
4150,Medium top and bottom fit great! :) love lovelove!
4151,I was so nervous ordering a suit online... I can never find one in stores that fit... If I could give more than5 stars I would! The fit is perfect and the fabric is such good quality. I will definitely only be getting my bikinis from sweet treats from now on!
4152,Absolutely over the moon satisfied
4153,I was a little confused with the string on the top of the bikini.  I didn't notice how it was pictured in the photo.  I did play with and was able to make it how I wanted.
4154,"Came as expected, size was perfect to size chat, really nice material!"
4155,"Very fast shipping , the most hottest leopard bikini bottoms !!!!!! I love the fabric and the way they feel and sit on my curves perfectly .will buy more from this shop again"
4156,Love everything about it!Would like to have the matching top.
4157,Amazing fit great quality came looking just like the picture I love it
4158,Gorgeous but admit to having ordered wrong size
4159,"Just received this in the mail and it fits PERFECT!!!!!
Measurements: 27 waist; 44 hips
Size ordered: XXL"
4160,fantastic! i'd recommend sizing up from your usual size in bottoms.
4161,"Absolutely love the suit! Great fabric and design, perfect fit. Thanks!"
4162,"Fits my curves wonderfully!! The sizing was accurate. I love the cut and rutched sides, and also the backside is made to cover perfectly. No unsighlty bum rolls! If I need another suit, I'll be placing an order again!"
4163,One word - fabulous! Thankyou xx
4164,I love it! Thank you!
4165,I can't wait to get it!!!
4166,"Beautiful, flattering, excellent fit, quality garment. I can't say enough how much I LOVE this suit. Can't wait to order another one!"
4167,Very cool print and design. It's a little tight at the thighs and shoulder but a larger size would be too big on me
4168,"SOOOO CUTE!! It fits awesome and I love the criss cross in the back! Took a little big longer to ship but still received them in a decent amount of time, thank you so much! Vegas here I come!!"
4169,It fits so perfectly and me being a 36dd it gave me support to as well as looking very sexy so happy to wear this top in Puerto Rico !!!!!!!!!
4170,Absolutely love this top! Was shipped on time and fits so well. I think I might buy a few more in different colors :)
4171,"Adorable! Fit well. Made of swimsuit material, lined, comes with pudding. Very bright- ready for ULTRA!!!"
4172,I can't wait to wear it in Mexico!!
4173,"Cute bikini top and very durable. I could see this lasting me for a some time. It's very flattering on almost any body type. The only thing is, I wish I would have gotten a size larger."
4174,"Fits perfect, does run small."
4175,The shipping was very fast!
4176,ultra fast
4177,Gorgeous and comfortable!!
4178,Great Condition. Came in quickly.
4179,Perfect fit.  It was a hit on the beach on my Special Day!
4180,Fit fine!! Perfect for birthday vacation
4181,"It's a nice bathing suit, the only thing for me was that it didnt fit. I looked they many reviews and the size i ordered fit tight. The top part of the bathing suit was to tight for my breasts. Overall too tight and it sucks that there is no returns or exchanges. Other than that the bathing suit is made out of good material and the printing looks beautiful."
4182,So cute my best friend love this gift for her 40th birthday.
4183,I got a small instead of an extra large
4184,The straps tend to fall off the shoulder a little and it’s not because of sizing because it fits every where else I think it’s just the style of the bathing suit. But for a one time wear it’ll be fine
4185,Very cute ruffle top! I can't wait to wear it on my trip! :) I'm a 34-36 dd and the top fit wonderfully with plenty of support!
4186,"Absolutely in love with it! Took a about a month to receive but very reasonable since their handmade. Looks amazing, great material nice and thick so no worries of being see-through. Highly recommend and will definitely be back for more :)
Thanks Lucy!"
4187,Lucy Bea's work is amazing. I got so many compliments. My top was a huge hit. Thanks Lucy Bea!!! :)
4188,I love this top! I can use it for work OR the poolside. I love it so much that I want another in Yellow! LucyBea was so helpful and her clothes are amazing...I'm so happy I bought this top! <3
4189,"It took a while to get the package but that is okay! I do wish it was a little brighter true ""turquoise"" but I still love it! I like the material and cant wait to show it off at the beach!"
4190,ABSOLUTELY LOVE!!! I normally have trouble finding swimsuit tops because of my cup size but this fits (and covers everything) perfectly!!!! It is so flattering and adorable!
4191,Fast....heck yeah!
4192,"I just received my bikini top today. I ordered 6 and a half weeks ago and it was shipped out 1 week ago. I didn't like waiting that long but lucy was good about replying to her emails.The stitching looks clean and the color is true to the color guide. Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
4193,"Gorgeous and super high quality, totally worth the wait!  I will definitely be a return buyer, just make sure you buy in advance because there is a bit of a wait before everything is ready to ship!"
4194,"Took about a month to receive, but when i did it was perfect. Measurements and everything was just how it was described and looked in photos! tons of compliments! would definitely buy again!!!"
4195,"looks great! a little smaller than I thought itd be in length, but I guess that means ill have to work harder at the gym! super awesome customer service! thanks so much!!!"
4196,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this top! i cant get over it! The item took a little longer to ship but communication with the seller was great. i would recommend to anyone and will be back!
4197,I never knew love like this before. This is absolutely PREFECT! I'm a 32J with dangling girls and this top covers me and lifts me while making me look and feel sexy. I have never been happy with other tops. I will definitely be ordering another at some point
4198,"Love the bikini.
nIt was easy to get a hold of Lucy Bea if I need to."
4199,"Amazing top, amazing seller!!!! Will use again and again"
4200,"I had trouble getting in contact with Lucy until I changed the subject name to my order conformation number. She then emailed me back immediately as she said most emails get dumped into her spam folder. Once I got in contact with her I told her I needed it by a certain date & she assured me I'd have it in plenty of time. She was right! I got the shipment notification on the 19th of August & I received it August 21st!!! I am IN LOVE with it. Great quality material. Looked super tiny but fit like a glove! Very, very impressed & will be back to order again!!! <3"
4201,Beautiful swimsuit top. This is my second one I've ordered. Love them
4202,Love it!! Thank you so much!!
4203,great style. very flattering. large bra size - perfect fit!!
4204,Totally love these suits! The quality & fit are Excellent!! A+
4205,"Absolutely love it! Fits perfectly. It did take a long time to arrive however. I would definitely order again, but not if I had a deadline."
4206,Exactly what I wanted! Thanks!!!
4207,Love the swimsuit made very well.
4208,LOVE this top! Can't wait to rock it this summer! :)
4209,The bathing suit top was super cute and fit really well. It's very flattering. I would buy from this vendor again.  I wish It would have shipped sooner. My only suggestion would be to maybe have the option to add an under-wire for tops bigger than a C cup for more support.
4210,"It took a long time to get to me, but it's cute!"
4211,My daughter LOVED it!!!! It looked so good on her..
4212,"Love the top, took longer to receive than expected."
4213,Very pleased once again! Great quality suit! Thank you!
4214,"Lucy and I had a rough start, but she has done everything she can to get my concerns resolved. I'm expecting my suit in the next few weeks and can't wait to see it!"
4215,LOVE! second ruffle top I've ordered.
4216,I do really enjoy this new bathing suit however I wish the ruffle material on my suit wasn't so long I got a double d however I should have probably ordered a D! Taking it on my honeymoon! :)
4217,"Seriously, best swimsuits ever.  Going to buy many many more."
4218,"Beautiful item.  Took longer than expected to arrive, but it was beautiful."
4219,"adorable! fits great, works with any bottoms."
4220,"Good top, if you don't mind getting it late."
4221,Great product and pretty design.
4222,It was delayed a little but that's was fine. Doesn't feel like much support but it looks cute. I like it
4223,"I ordered it February 28, 2012. It stated to allow 4-7 business days to be shipped out. She marked it on March 11, 2012 that it was shipped out, but when I contacted her March 20th, it really wasn't shipped out until the 19th when she gave me the tracking information. I finally received it on March 23, way more than 4-7 business days later. The top was cute, but because of this long shipping, I may be hesitant to order from this company again."
4224,Top was great... a few spots of thread were already coming undone but thankfully that is a simple fix that I can take care of. The purchase was over one week late and I actually had to contact the seller to find out she was behind in her shipments due to an increase in sales. This is something she should have contacted the buyers about not the other way around. I then sent another email asking if it was going to be delayed further and she then sent me the shipment info. Again not something I should have had to ask. The communication was horrible.
4225,Item matched description but arrived rather late.
4226,"Cute swimsuit but I don't recommend you order from this company. I received my swimsuit over 7 weeks after I placed and paid for my order. It states the products ship in 4-6 weeks but that is not true. I needed this for a beach vacation, tried to reach the owner twice and never received a response. When I filed a complaint it was not handled to my satisfaction by the owner or Etsy. I paid for something I was going to use on vacation and didn't get a chance to wear it for my special event. Very disappointing, bad customer service!"
4227,"Just got my Greek flag bikini top today, and I LOVE IT!!!!😊  True to size fit, very nice material, and excellent stitching. I can't wait until I go to Greece next year so I can wear it on the beach! Thanks SO much!"
4228,Looks amazing!! Just like the picture.
4229,Fits great and shipped on time before headkng overseas
4230,IN LOVE
4231,In love with this bathing suit
4232,"Adorable swimsuit, fits great and is very well made! Was able to easily exchange the bottoms for a different size, just took quite a long time shipping back and forth. I will definitely be back for more swimsuits!!"
4233,"cutest bikni ever!!!
Priya's customer service is also wonderful :)
thank you so much!"
4234,"Beautiful.  Great quality, fit perfectly and fast shipping.  I've already ordered another one."
4235,Another masterfully created swimsuit! swim suit genius!
4236,Loved the bathing suit!  I got so many compliments thank you so much!
4237,I love this swimsuit! Summer isn't even here yet and I bought it early because it looks amazing. Tried it on and fits and looks awesome and great quality TYSM! :D
4238,"Love it! Will definitely be making future purchases. Any questions, just ask. Shop is quick with response time."
4239,"Very pleased! I was a touch nervous buying a swimsuit on-line without ever having tried it on because I have very pear-shaped proportions. Lisa was very communicative. I wasn't sure how long something like this would take since it's not listed, but from point of sale to receiving it, it was right around 3 weeks, which is amazing for something custom made. I'm sure it varies based off the swimsuit, but so happy. And it fits perfectly! (See my low quality photo.) :D"
4240,I absolutely love this bikini! Fits perfectly and is adjustable! Good quality material and great customer service! Thank you so much! Can't wait to wear it on my cruise!
4241,I absolutely love love mine definitely recommend this shop. It's great quality fast shipping and comfortable
4242,It's even more gorgeous then the picture! Looks really well made! I can't wait to wear this beauty on my cruise! Definitely worth every penny!
4243,"Fantastic work! I had originally received my order which had some fitting issues, so I reached out and Fit2betied was prompt and went OVER the top to help me. Even went so far as to re-make and fit to my personal style of top. HIGHLY recommend."
4244,Perfect! Fits fantastic 😬
4245,Favorite new article of clothing! This lady is super talented!! I absolutely love everything i have ordered! If you havent ordered yet you need to! It will get here quick!
4246,I love it! Fits perfectly. Took a little time to get here but since I assume she's making them to order it was still fairly fast.
4247,It's awesome! Fits perfectly. Really love this bikini.
4248,"I recieved my swimsuit, and it is perfect! I asked to have it before a certain date, and Lisa worked with me to make it happen. She produces quality suits. Lisa is quick to respond, pleasent to work with, and very professional. Thank you for the stellar, unique suimsuit!!"
4249,"Got this bikini yesterday and LOVE it!!! It fits great, looks great, the detail on it is wonderful, and I'm super excited to wear it to the beach next week!"
4250,My friend loves the bikini! People still confuse her for Zelda tho. 🤣
4251,Absolutely loved this. Can't wait to wear it!
4252,"Now I am jealous that this is not for me! Super, super cute! She is going to love it! (So will her boyfriend)"
4253,"Great quality, fast shipping, I love it! Can't wait until the weather gets nice enough to wear it!"
4254,My wife absolutely loved the zelda bikini!! Fit perfectly and size was perfect!
4255,Beautiful!! Fits nicely!!
4256,Item fits perfectly. Seller was great with helping me! Shipped quickly too!!
4257,"Great product, but I wish there were the thin pads in the cups to keep the shape (for those of us that are small chested)"
4258,"The bottom on this one was lower in the front than I expected, but the fit is great otherwise. Of course, the colours are fantastic!"
4259,"Bikini looks great and is comfy to wear. Great communication with seller, quick production/shipping!"
4260,My wife loves it! I think its hot!
4261,"I thought the bikini was gonna be green like the picture, but when I got it it was black. Then I looked at it again, and realized there was an option to select which color you want, so technically it was my own fault I didn't see it before. I just wish the picture would have shown the bikini in both green and black, then I would have known there were different options for color. Oh well."
4262,Fits like an absolute dream. It’s such a beautiful suit and I feel great when I wear it. It holds up very well and isn’t uncomfortable at all!! So happy I bought this. Kooj was polite and professional.
4263,"Oh my goodness, this is an amazing swimsuit. I'm beyond happy with it, and it fits amazingly! The seller was really quick to respond, and very open to making a few adjustments. I will never buy a swimsuit from a store again!!"
4264,Perfect fit I also appreciate the carrying case for the suit that came with it. Thank you!
4265,Yeah !!!! Finally....I found high hip bathing suit bottoms !!!! Impossible to find in retail stores.  I am so happy I found this site !!! I love my new bathing suit bottoms !!!  Thank you so very much !!!
4266,"Great product and great seller.  Package arrived wrapped up like a birthday present, which was adorable, much appreciated, and an extra unplanned little bonus since that was what it was intended to be."
4267,"Fits really nice and looks great ! Great seller , really courteous and really fast shipping ❤️❤️❤️"
4268,"I ordered this top as well as similar monokini and they are BOTH absolutley AMAZING!!! Great quality, fits well and I recieved a ton of compliments while wearing them on vaca in Hawaii. Customer service was just as amazing as the swimsuits - she was super fast, accomodating and made the ordering process a breeze. Will for sure be ordering in more colors!"
4269,I will definitely get more things from this shop! The bathing suit top I got fits PERFECTLY  and looks super cute and I will definitely be the only one on the cruise I'm going on with anything like it! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!
4270,"I purchased the long ruffle swim top in purple and black.  I wear a size 14 and was concerned, but these tops are sexy, flattering and well made.  Mine arrived before the date I had requested them.  I can't wait to rock these on vacation and purchase other colors."
4271,Love love love this top!! So much so I ordered it in two different colors :) Thank you!!!!
4272,"AMAZING top!  Love it, it covers any slight tummy stretch marks and you can still feel cute in a two piece!  Great quality"
4273,"I ordered my bikini top on April 2nd and received it on May 4th, even though it took a little longer than 3 weeks to receive it, I am 100% happy with the product. I wasn't in any hurry to get my bikini top so it wasn't a huge issue for me! Great quality! I will definitely order from her again!"
4274,"omg i got my swim top and LOVE it!!!!!!! ive always had a hard time finding tops due to haveing large breast they never had enough support or i was spilling out i told her exactly what i wanted ( thick straps, what  brand/size bra ect) and it was perfect im ordering 2 more in a dif color thanks soooo much"
4275,"Great craftsmanship, as usual. This is my 4th purchase from Lucy. Love her stuff!"
4276,Thank you so much. The top fits perfect!!!
4277,"Fast shipping, good communication,love the design of the top. I just wish it had a little more support to the top or structure. If not tied really tight, you may lose your top in the water. Over all still really love the top."
4278,love it can hardly wait for the white one love
4279,Love it! Thanks for the rush!
4280,"Sexy top, yet still covers my problem area. This is my second one!"
4281,Love the top! Very pretty.
4282,"it takes a little while to figure it out how to get things tied, but it is worth it, i love it! color pewter is so lovely. The quality of the yarn is amazing. If you want a one of a kind bikini you should get it."
4283,"Love it! It's beautifully made & the color is gorgeous!! Shipping was fast too.

I'll probably order a larger size in both the top and the bottom next time tho. Bottoms are a bit cheeky (I can still rock it nicely) and the top has a lot of side boob action for someone without much there haha."
4284,Not only do I absolutely love the product but the customer service is so awesome! The hand written thank you note is so nice and greatly appreciated
4285,The fabric felt amazing! Cannot wait to wear this!
4286,I can't find many tops that fit a larger size chest so I was happy to find this one! Thank you!
4287,Beautiful work and sexy too!  Thank you!
4288,Absolutely love it! They did exactly as I asked and it just looks AWESOME. I am so pleased and can't wait to wear it to the pool. im normally a 12/14 but am 4 months pregnant and the large 14 fit comfortably with enough room for a small growing belly. Super pleased!
4289,"the suit was cute, I should have ordered a small instead of Medium because the straps were a little loose. I'm 5''1 so maybe if you're taller it would help."
4290,Lettering was crooked and really low on the swim suit
4291,Great material and writing. Loved it!
4292,"Fits well, good quality. Ordered for a bachelorette party and all of us are pleased with the results."
4293,"Wow, this top is beautiful. Its soft and fits perfect and is flattering and the beads are a nice touch. Very happy with this, love it, thanks."

The quality is exceptional and when we asked if they could rush it so she could have it in time, they got right on it and it got here within a few days! It fit her perfectly, as they asked for my daughter's measurements to tailor it to her. We were both so impressed by the craftsmanship! Would definitely purchase again!"

4314,"I just received my Helen swimsuit and it fits like a glove!  I have an awkward shaped body and Kathy was able to make it perfectly off of my general clothes sizes. She was quick, helpful, and made a great quailty product. I usually don't use etsy much much but I would definitely buy from Kathy again. Thank you!!!"
4315,I love this swimming suit. I don't think I'll ever need or want any other one but this one. It's very well made and fits perfectly. I took it to Miami Beach for my birthday and complete strangers commented on how happy I look in it. Kathy and Justine are so kind and wonderful to deal with. Great customer service.

4323,"I am really happy with my purchase, the swimsuit fits perfectly. The service was very kind and caring."
4324,"Great Suit, fits like a glove!!"
4325,"I received my digital pattern quickly, the crochet bikini top pattern was easy to understand with detailed explanations and photos. I love how it came out! (I made mine longer, so it is more of a tankini than a bikini top.)"
4326,"This pattern is 
amazing!😊"
4327,Such an easy pattern to follow! Great work girl! 💕
4328,The bride to be loved her bikini
4329,"Good fit, excellent customer service, good reply time on queries."
4330,Horrible quality and not true to size
4331,Very thin no lining. I’m not able to wear it.
4332,my eife love it 👩🏝🤙
4333,Love this bathing suit. Looks just like the pic. It did not come with the  top pads but it was easy for me to add.

4344,Not made very well. Material is cheap.
4345,I loved it just like the picture fits great
4346,"The bodysuit fits perfectly when worn, and is beautifully made from durable latex 
Be mindful that the lack of zipper makes it quite difficult to get the garment over the hips- definitely recommend a dressing aid"
4347,"I ordered using the same colours from Ebay website (M40 blue main colour, S50 orange trim) which matches the picture.  Actual colours appear darker than picture, especially orange trim.  But otherwise OK."
4348,no complaints. well made and exactly as described.
4349,The connectors are of great quality and I feel confident they will look great on stage. Sonya was also easy to work with and quick to find a solution for an issue I ran in to. Great product and great customer service!
4350,Beautiful! Love the quality of the pieces and the communication with the owner is top notch!
4351,Sehr schöne Verarbeitung und funkelt extrem. Artikel wurde sehr schnell versandt und termingerecht an.
4352,"I was trying to exchange the item, it didn’t fit or look good with my suit! But she never contacted me back about it!"
4353,It’s really nice has a good body to it💪🏽👊🏽♥️
4354,Very sturdy bikini connectors but the chain in the back keeps stabbing me in my hip.
4355,"I'm very pleased with the bathing suit, it's exactly as depicted, the measurements are a perfect fit, it's high quality & exceptional craftsmanship, I can't wait to wear it on vacation in Panama City, Panama, Central America,  Memorial Day Weekend!! I will definitely be ordered additional pieces from you!! 
Thanks!!"
4356,I love my bathing suit. I have already worn it and felt amazing in it. Quick shipping and the seller quickly responded to questions when I had one.
4357,Amazing custom fit and I love it!! So thankful!
4358,Gorgeous! And the customer service is beyond what I expected!
4359,I feel great in this!
4360,For the price I paid for this bathing suit I expected way better quality. The bands feel so uncomfortable. I’ll probably never wear this.
4361,"Quickest arrival from the US (to London) ever! Shipped on Tuesday, it arrived on Friday. Amazing. This swimsuit is the most perfect and lovely I've ever owned. I love the 50s retro style, the eye popping colours and the polka dots. The cut and style was just perfect for me, I only wish I'd ordered a Medium instead of a Small as the Small is a bit too tight, though of course it stretches. Thanks again for your handiwork!"
4362,"Absolutely beautiful! This swimsuit is finely tailored, made to flatter, and made to last. Worth every penny!"
4363,This shop is awesome. Christy went above and beyond to make sure I got a perfect fit. The suits are high quality craftsmanship and I loved it so much I bought a second one. I will definitely purchase another in the future.
4364,this seller is very trust worthy.  had to return bathing suit quick reply bathing suit was returned and fit perfect! quality materials would recommend to anyone!
4365,"LOVE. perfect fit, well made, great material, awesome cut. i finally have a suit i love and can't wait to wear at every opportunity."
4366,I love it!!
4367,"This suit is absolutely amazing! Everything is perfect, from the fabric and design to the expert craftsmanship. I feel like a million bucks in it! Can't wait for my next pool or beach day. Thanks!!"
4368,This swimsuit is so cute and very comfortable! My transaction was very fast and easy! High quality work! Thank you!
4369,I love this suit! It has tummy control that I wasn't expecting but gladly has. (After 4 births my stomach will never be the same.) Christy is very talented and was beyond helpful when a slight shipping mishap occurred. I highly recommend this vendor and will buy again when the need arises.
4370,Thanks for getting back to me so quickly about shipping. I absolutely love this suit and it fits great. Thank you!
4371,Absolutely gorgeous wrap - Beautiful colour - can't wait to wear it
4372,Beautiful pareo - nice feel to material and great color!
4373,Fit great!
4374,so pretty--love the color! would buy again
4375,The stitching was actually terrible . I only put it on once and it fits perfectly. But the stitching came out and I paid $45 for the bottoms . you receive no top. So I'm very very very displeased
4376,Do not EVER buy from this woman! I waited an entire month thinking I was getting an entire swimsuit for $45  only to find that it was only the bottoms  I would have never paid that much if I knew that. I feel ripped off! Not happy at all!!!!
4377,"The reason why I gave 3 stars because 1. my bathing suit came in the mail late. I contacted the seller wondering why my bathing suit bottom didn't come. I then was notify that something happen to her store. I understand, but you should of told your customer that it will be late. If I didn't even contacted her I wouldn't even know.   2. I thought I was going to receive my item the day after I was going to Las Vegas so I was pretty mad, but needless to say, I received it a day before my trip.    3. I like the bathing suit bottom, but it was a little too big, and my waist and hip number was accurate, but if I knew I would of gotten a large instead a xl, but since there's no return what can I do."
4378,"Ashley did a wonderful job on my suit!! It's very pretty, fits just right, and she was very easy to get a hold of. Definitley recommend her work"
4379,Beautiful!!!! I opened the bag and was in love. Only took one week to order and receive it.  It is just like the picture and fits 100% accurately. I am so thankful for all the emails and double checking so that I got the perfect suit that is ready to go and needs no altering. Again thank you so much for everything!!!
4380,"I purchased this suit for my first fitness competition and was extremely nervous about the fit. Ashley was extremely sensitive and understanding to my apprehension. She was willing to go above and beyond to ensure that I was comfortable and happy with the suit. She went as far as giving me her PERSONAL TELEPHONE number  so that I could reach out to her directly so that we could discuss my fears. Needless to say I was just experiencing pre competition jitters, and the suit fit and worked out PERFECTLY!! I even WON the competition!!! Thank you so much ASHLEY YOU ROCK!!! I will definitely be purchasing my next competition suit from you!!! You have gained a loyal customer in me!!!!"
4381,I received my bikini very quickly and it fits amazingly!! Ashley is quick to respond to messages which I greatly appreciate. The color is beautiful and exactly as it looked in the photo! Everyone I have shown it to has raved about it :)
4382,"Thanks again Ashley for a great suit and terrific customer service.  Ashley is always willing to go above and beyond to make sure that her customers are satisfied and receive the product that they purchased!  This is the second suit I have purchased from Ashley, and I will continue to be a repeat customer."
4383,Everyone loved the swimsuit for my 30th birthday! Thanks!
4384,Swimsuits looked great! Very form fitting. I personally purchased an XL and I’m 5’8 and 175lbs. Would purchase again!
4385,"Loved my suits material was great! Thank
You!!!"
4386,Swimsuit was perfect!!! XL for 5’7 175lb body type!!! Loved it!
4387,Oh my gosh so cute!!! Fit great and the lettering is so good!! Thank you!!
4388,Fit perfectly on my curves 👍🏽
4389,Perfect fit. True to size. I’m a medium in clothes and ordered a medium. 5’6 140 lbs.
4390,Fit beautifully. Absolutely worth the money
4391,Love the fit and style! I've purchased this swimsuit in 3 different colors and love each one!
4392,"I would say this runs a bit small in size. Super cute though! I order a small and am 5""5 - 115lbs - 34B and it's snug. We ordered these for a bachelorette party in a few weeks and I know those with bigger chests wish they would have went up in size."
4393,Great suit! Got so many compliments
4394,Fits great! Love the color. Very comfortable.
4395,"The bathing suit is cute, but it’s very see through. I had to sew in extra lining."
4396,Great fit! Would order again!
4397,True to size. Fits great and is made of quality!
4398,Not made for tall people with a long torso.
4399,Amazing quality!! I received many compliments. Thank you

4401,Great customer service!
4402,Bommmb and quick shipping
4403,Very nice quality and service was really fast
4404,Very nice quality and service was really fast
4405,Very nice quality and service was really fast
4406,Very nice quality and service was really fast
4407,Swimsuit was great but letters started coming off after one wash
4408,GREAT customer service. I had accidentally placed an order for a black suit when I wanted a red one. It took one email to them explaining my mistake and they responded within minutes and corrected the issue for me without any problem. The suit came and it is EXACTLY what I wanted and fit perfectly.
4409,LOVE THIS! I have large 34DDD and the XL was perfect. I did take in the back a little just so I wouldnt loose it in the water! LOL
4410,so comfy
4411,"Originalité, vintage, efficacité de l'artisan,"
4412,Great quality and the fit is perfect!
4413,"LOVE my new bikini! I'm dressing up as Ariel for Halloween and was having a hard time finding a bra I liked to go with my tail. Then, luckily I came across this shop and fell in love with this bikini. Not only will it work perfect for my costume, but I am so excited to wear this to the pool. But the tops and bottoms fit wonderfully and the quality is really great. Not only that but I received the item only a few days after I placed the order, wonderful service. Will definitely be a returning customer!"
4414,Cute swim suit. Recently arrived
4415,Great quality! Only wish the top was padded/lined a little
4416,Perfect and arrived quicker than the turn around date for no extra cost. Thank you!!
4417,thank you so much i love the bottoms!
4418,Very comfortable and well made. Fits perfectly.
4419,Lovely material and wonderful fit… You won't regret a purchase!
4420,Poor quality. There are so many loose threads hanging from the seams that I’ll be surprised if it goes through one wash or one wear. I’ve seen better quality from sewing classes in my old high school.
4421,Bought as a gift for my sister. She loved it
4422,So in love with this suit! It is absolutely gorgeous! Thank you so much! I cannot wait to get more for this summer!
4423,Cutest bottom ever! Makes your butt look great. True to size and made out of good quality fabric.
4424,"thank you so much!!!!
perfect!!!"
4425,Thank you so much!its perfect!
4426,"Great fit, this bottom is fabulous."
4427,Amazing bathing suit; fast shipping and great customer service. Thank you!
4428,"Yay, good purchase.  I highly recommend this seller."
4429,The bottoms are very comfortable.
4430,It fits great and is good quality beautiful and comfortable bikini.
4431,"Love this bathing suit! I’m 5’2, 119lbs.. were an extra small on top(shirts and tops) and a large on bottom.. I went with the large but I did have to get it altered because the top portion was steal my big.. but that’s because of the way my body is shaped. I loved it, and got so many compliments"
4432,Love my “bride” swimsuit from here! I’m 5’7” and 133 pounds and I got a M which fit perfectly!
4433,"Suggest getting a larger size; mine fit wonderfully and I am a 135 lb, 5 ft 7 in, 34 B, 32 inch waist.  Really made my sister's bachelorette bash special!"
4434,"Loved these!! Company was so easy to work with for express shipping and they came out so great!! I am 5'9, 135 lbs, and the medium fit great! It does ride high in the thigh, but looks really flattering!! Chest fit well in the suit and I got the cross back option, and it looked amazing, got tons of compliments on them! Would easily work with this company again!"
4435,"I am tall about 5'8 with double D boobs body type medium frame. It fit well but was a little ""boob-a-litious"" lol. I was just happy it didn't come up too high on the hips. It fit pretty traditionally in the bottom region. Overall I am very excited to wear it for our bachelorette weekend! Good find"
4436,The bathing suit fit great and was amazing quality!!! It shipped very quickly as well.
4437,"The suit was perfect! It shipped in exactly 1 week which was a pleasant suprise. I’m 5’4, 146lbs, 34DD & I ordered a medium. After reading the reviews about the letters peeling, I went over them with an iron & parchment paper and they stayed put all night (I was in salt water though) overall, I was extremely happy!!"
4438,I love my swimsuit. Just want to say I am 5'10 with a long torso and size large fit me perfect.
4439,"This is SO cute, fits perfectly, and I love the style.  The quality is super high, too.  Also, it arrived early, which was super nice since I needed it for a vacation."
4440,Such fast shipping and absolutely love it! Usually a true medium and it felt a little smaller than I would have liked but hoping it stretches in the water
4441,Was the best for my bachelorette party!
4442,Small was a bit short on me but I’m 5’11 so I expected it. Still fit. I ordered a medium in a diff color and it is more comfortable but both are great quality! Fast shipping.
4443,"It's exactly how i pictured it in my head! I almost didn't order because i waited until the last minute to make my mind up. I thought i didn't have enough time. Well, it came right on time and it was perfect! Love your prompt and precise service. My 50th Beach-themed birthday Party is complete! #50TheNewFword #5 Ohhh!"
4444,Love it! Quality looks good and is just what I expected. Perfect Fit.
4445,Love it!!!
4446,"Fits good, shipped fast. Went up a size (usually a medium went to a large) because I have a long torso and one pieces tend to try to pull me down. Large is perfect!"
4447,"I absolutely loved this item! Runs true to size, but beware because it is a bit high cut on the legs and butt. My friends and I are all over 5'10 and the L fit perfectly, but it is high cut on the legs. The blue is such a pretty color, but since it doesn't have pads can be a bit nippy. The black might have been a better option for us, but nonetheless a high quality suit and beautiful color."
4448,Fits perfect! Way better quality than expected and it turned out so cute!
4449,"Fit perfect, and was very flattering and comfortable. The letters falling off or ruining didn’t concern me at all, I played multiple different outdoor games and used a slip n slide all day and everything stayed in tact!"
4450,They made an error on my bathing suits but were great at fixing it very fast and were very understanding. Highly recommend!!
4451,Not too thin like I was scared about - I can't wait to wear it!
4452,Love it! Absolutely fast shipping I was very satisfied.
4453,So happy with my suit! Great fit and fast shipping.
4454,Super Fast shipping - received 2 days after placing my order with the rush shipping add on. I would recommend sizing up.
4455,"I loved the suit itself. It fit great and to size. The letters, however, started to peel off after one use."
4456,Thank you I️ loved the bathing suits.. definitely will order again
4457,This suit came within a few days of ordering it. The quality is great and the suit is really cute. I needed to change the wording and I contacted the shop and they made the changes for me. Great customer service!
4458,Perfect fit love this item !
4459,"The entire pool staff is obsessed with this, thanks!"
4460,It came quick and was of amazing quality!
4461,Great suit and fit good. Only complaint is the letters started peeling up after the first use. Great customer service though and shipped fast.
4462,It’s pretty cute but the lettering was printed on a little crooked and in a somewhat awkward spot (right below the boobs). I think a little more care and attention could be put into the screen printing but the swimsuit itself fits well and feels good.
4463,So adorable! I can’t wait to bring this to my bachelorette party and my honeymoon :)
4464,"This was exactly what I was looking for.  The first item had a typo, but the seller corrected and shipped out a new one quickly."
4465,Awkward and the letters peeled off the day I was wearing it. Overall not bad after I took the letters off
4466,Great and fast service. Seller responds quickly to messages.
4467,The white swimsuit is completely see through in the back. Lettering alignment was off.
4468,If you have an issue with your order don’t bother. There’s no solution and then they want to give you a measly 10%. That doesn’t even cover their shipping. Never again.
4469,This swimsuit is poorly made. The letters came off after one wear.
4470,"Great quality of suit and arrived on time for a bachelorette party! This style of suit is a little out of my comfort zone, and had a hard time selecting size, but I picked as well as I could for this suit! I am a little curvy - 36C and size 10 pants and the XL is perfect! It's little awkward on top (no cup support) and when I take 2 steps, the bottom rides up.  Not the shop's fault at all - the suit is as great as can be, just not a suit made for all sized women."
4471,The bathing suit is super cute but there is barely any padding for the breast area. They run a little tight as well.
4472,Came in a week and a half. Thank you!
4473,It fits perfectly and i can't wait to wear it on my bachelorette!
4474,"The swimsuit is perfect, it comfortable and makes you look so good! I can’t wait to wear this for my bachelorette party!"
4475,Love it!!! Can’t wait to wear it.
4476,"The white bathing suit is completely sheer in the back you can see everything. The front is double lined and thicker, but it's like they forgot to double line the back. I contacted the seller letting them know about this and they would not let me return the item. I am VERY disappointed with the quality, especially with the price of this item. Do not buy, at least don't buy the white color, from this shop."
4477,Too small and unable to exchange
4478,Exactly what I wanted & fast shipping! My daughter loved her swim suit for her Spa Party Theme! #Little Miss Spa- Bella
4479,The girls were so cute in their swimsuits.  They were perfect for the occasion.
4480,My Baby love it went Great with her theme perfect Fit and comfortable for her 💕
4481,The swimsuits look so great!
4482,I loved the swimsuits for my little girls!!
4483,The girls swimsuits came very fast and are really cute!!
4484,I love the swimsuit! It's so cute and simple; the little one is so excited to go swimming in it too!
4485,Letters started to peel before wearing. Seller sent another one right away. Came out great.
4486,Perfect and fast shipping. I got a matching one for me also
4487,Super cute and very fast shipping!
4488,Very cute. Sizing runs a little small. I asked for measurements before purchasing but they had none available.  My daughter just turned 9 and the 10 barely fits. She is averaged size compared to her classmates.
4489,"Fast shipping, lookin exactly like on photos. Awesome."
4490,Great quality and Fast shipping I will be ordering again!
4491,Good quality and fast shipment!
4492,EVERY other seller worked with me to ensure I received my merchandise for my first born’s First birthday... This seller could care less. Took my money ... No merchandise ... Not willing to even try to suggest Possible resolutions.
4493,First wash and lettering came off very disappointed
4494,"So cute and such amazing quality, super soft and fits perfectly!! I am a size 32D/34C and I would’ve got a size larger but still fits well:) I highly recommend!"
4495,beautiful thank you!!
4496,Took ages to send item but once sent was speedy
4497,Such a cute suit for my bachelorette party! Everyone looked amazing in them.
4498,"Super Cute! Shipping was very slow, but I believe it is because these are custom made. Definitely worth purchasing, just provide yourself a cushion of time to receive. I'm looking forward to wearing this during my wedding weekend."
4499,Price is good. Fits a litte loose
4500,I like it! It a a bluish tint to it which is kind of off but it’s mostly white!
4501,Love loved my swimsuit! Exactly what I wanted. Material is great.
4502,"Shipped & arrived quickly! This is my 3rd suit from this shop, had great service on last years purchase so I came back when choosing a suit for my stag. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is that the back of the suit isn’t lined (yellow suit). I can see my tattoo & bum crack through the suit, I feel it’ll only get worse when wet. It’s for my stag in LV so it doesn’t really bother me tooo much as I’m sure I’ll be enjoying liquid libations."
4503,Shipping on time and is good quality! Love the colors
4504,Little too high cut for me in the legs but fits good otherwise
4505,"I am always so happy when I get these colorful kantha swatches delivered. Beautiful colors and patterns, so much fun! I will return."
4506,"super je suis satisfaite du colis. il y a de belles couleurs différentes mais beaucoup de rose et j'adore le rose.
Quand j'aurai tout utiliser je pense que je repasserai commande."
4507,"These fabrics are glorious!! So much more than I was expecting to receive, and indescribably beautiful. Thank you so much for curating these, and for your wonderful and prompt customer service."
4508,Fantastic service and great material. Even my 7yo son was enthusiastic (he is the most critic reviewer of my purchases). Thank you!
4509,I am fully pleased and satisfied!
4510,"Arrived today, thank you, just what I was looking for."
4511,"I absolutely LOVE  this bathing suit...so much so I ordered three! Small medium and large ruffle.  The large ruffle is perfect for days you want to hide your mid drift a little with out wearing some hideous tankini. The fit is very flattering and being able to choose from several colors was great. I live in Massachusetts, so shipping took some time. But totally worth the wait. Custom fit, high quality and durable. Make this my favorite bikini of all time."
4512,"Love the bathing suit! The top fit great, bottoms were a little big, but wasn't worth any complaining because the whole suit was so cute! Shipping was fast and I got it right on time when i needed it."
4513,"Love it, love it, love it!  Came right on time and it's absolutely gorgeous!  Got a ton of compliments on the beach in sunny Florida.  Thank you so much!!"
4514,Just got my long ruffle bikini today and I love it!! I highly recommend it to others! The only things is that I found that the size chart was a little off. It said that the extra-large was a size 8-10 but a large would've been a bit better because it's a little loose. It still fits really good though. Thank you!! :)
4515,OMG!!!! Lucy you are the best!!! I love love love this swimsuit! Red is absolutely gorgeous and the material is quality!!! Thank you for the extreme fast shipping!!!
4516,OMG! I just love it (AND my bf)! ;) Wonderful and just perfect! Lucy and her work are amazing! I'm so pleased and happy! :D
4517,"Best swimsuit ever!! So comfortable, so dazzling and the service and shipment was great!!!"
4518,"I love my bikini!! its incredibly flattering and so different from anything else I've seen. I wish the top came with padding built into it so it was a little more supportive, but it still looks and fits great."
4519,Absolutely stunning! Modest and sexy all at the same time :-) incredibly figure enhancing and just feel like a goddess wearing them. Thanks so much Lucy!!
4520,"It took longer then I anticipated, but well worth the wait!"
4521,LOVE IT!!  great communication and fast ship!!
4522,Wow - I don't think I ever had a bikini that fit me so well.  Great price for a custom bikini!
4523,"Unfortunately my item was lost in the postal system for a month, so it was very late being delivered, but the seller sent it when she said she would so it was out of her control. Absolutely love the bikini design and colour!"
4524,I love it !
4525,"Although the swimsuit took a little over a month to ship, it's all about quality. I absolutely love the swimsuit; the dimensions/measurements fit like a glove, there are no loose threads or crooked seams, the hemming is extremely well-done, and the material feels very comfortable. This is probably the best swimsuit I have bought in my life! I will definitely be a repeat customer :) I wish I could post a photo of me in my new suit."
4526,Love it!
4527,"This swimsuit is exactly as pictured. I found the bottom to be slightly small, but I still love it and am super excited to wear it!"
4528,"This swimsuit is amazing, I couldn't be happier. It fits wonderfully and is very flattering. Thanks a million."
4529,Cute!
4530,Fits perfectly and is super cute and comfy!
4531,LOVE THIS BIKINI! So colorful and fits well!
4532,Super high quality-wonderful fit!   So excited!  Thank you
4533,Thank you. Fits great and the blue is beautiful!
4534,"Swimsuit is a perfect fit, I received on time. I would def. buy from this line again;)"
4535,Timely delivery! And the swimsuit is so cute and unique! I can't wait to wear it! I def will be a repeat customer
4536,Love it can't wait to wear it took a little long for it to come in but that's was fine because u can't wear it yet :))
4537,"Took 3 weeks to receive as opposed to the 1 week that is advertised, but the high value and quality of the bathing suit makes up for it.  I would purchase from this seller again."
4538,"I ordered two bathing suits from this shop with confidence.I gave the shop over 2 months to have them done by.They came late,ignored 3 of my emails and only sent my items after I opened a case with Etsy. I thought the nightmare was over,but then I opened my package to find my bathing suits to be in the COMPLETE wrong size. I ordered D cup bathing suits and I recieved A cup or possibly smaller.I don't even know if they would fit my 90 pound 10 year old cousin. I am in the process of returning them but if it takes another 3 months to recieve my correct order then I will pursue a refund. I am so frustrated and disappointed. ORDER THROUGH THIS COMPANY WITH CAUTION."
4539,Great quality. I’m 5 7 150 and I got a medium and it fits perfectly. Can’t wait to wear it for Christmas in July!
4540,Loved this one piece! Great quality!
4541,Came super fast and exactly as pictured! Very happy with it
4542,Such a cute swimsuit. My friends loved it!!
4543,"Never received my item, reached out to the shop for help with filing a claim at the post office and was told their responsibility for the package stops once they put it in the mailbox. While I understand they can't control the post office, its disappointing they provided zero assistance and I am out $60 for the two swimsuits I ordered."
4544,Love the top but very see through!
4545,"So comfortable and cute I want to order so,I'd clors so I can mix and match"
4546,It's cute and arrived on time but it does not stay up very well. Had issues with pulling it up every 10 seconds so I wouldn't flash anyone at the beach.
4547,the owner quickly replys and is will to ship out a new if sizing is off
4548,Love this swimsuit! Used the sizing info in the listing and it fits perfect. It's super cute and just sexy enough. :)
4549,Item came exactly as described! Color exactly as pictured and printed very well. Sizing is accurate! Would recommend.
4550,Hot pink was sold out which I didn't know of other colors till I had to choose between neon green💚  and neon yellow💛 I chose the green which is also cute!
4551,great customer service and I received by product quickly!
4552,Fit beautifully and was made of a nice material. I sent my weight with measurements and was notified that they'd be sending me a different size. Fits great!
4553,"Fits amazingly. Very high quality material. Soft with perfect amount of stretch. FAST delivery
 Exactly as pictured."
4554,"I’ve never ordered a bathing suit off Etsy before, so I wasn’t sure how this would turn out. I am so glad I ordered because this is one of the most well-made & unique bathing suits I have ever purchased! Thank you!"
4555,"Material, Shape, Quality of product is amazing. Fit a bit more snug than the other suit i purchased. Both were size M. I love the print."
4556,Perfect Exactly  what I wanted !!!!
4557,"Beautiful suit, medium fit me perfectly (5”8, 140lbs, c34), wonderful seller. Recommend!"
4558,This bathing suit is truly beautiful! It is really well-made and very flattering. Seller was really helpful with sizing and the swimsuit arrived earlier than expected.

4564,Thank you for the custom service help. Even though I not able to have the product but they help me with the refund. Thanks again for all your effort.
4565,"Great quality and fit, fast delivery, thank you!"
4566,It was fun to wear for my husband's birthday party. Everyone liked it.
4567,"Just as described! Shipped right away and it was a great suggestion to go a size up from what I would normally order as the suits run small. 
Just FYI for those ordering, the side boob is real! haha! I don't think I realized how much it would be but I still love it!"
4568,Very happy with my order
4569,Shipped on time and was very cute
4570,I recommend ordering two sizes up. Great communication with seller!
4571,"Its so cute, however it is a little more minty than it looks in the picture so if you are going to buy it keep that in mind! it also fits true to your size!"
4572,I love this bathing suit! I absolutely love the color and fits amazing! I’m definitely ordering another color 😊
4573,Smalł was too small. Mediums as too big. These are not true to size
4574,I was the Little Mermaid for Halloween!!!! And I absolutely loved the high waisted bathing suit bottoms. Thanx to TheGoodWitchClothing my costume turned out to be a success! Thanx again xoxo
4575,I love feeling like a glamorous mermaid! These bottoms fit perfectly and are very well made with high quality fabric. I washed them and they still look new!
4576,"I LOVE these high waisted mermaid bikini bottoms! I got the black shimmery ones and they're awesome! Super cute, very comfy, and don't ride up. They fit very well; I used my measurements to figure out which size to order and it's a perfect fit. Lots of coverage so I don't feel too exposed. And they came just in time for my vacation to the beach! Will definitely be recommending this store to all my friends who enjoy wearing cool/fun outfits."
4577,"Very good quality. I ordered an XS and it was true to size. I originally ordered a color that I didn't love when I saw it in person, so the seller was generous enough to exchange it for a different color. Great seller, great product. Thank you!"
4578,Came perfect and good quality! Love the combo for a mermaid style fashion suit. Thank you so much!
4579,I accidentally got sent the gold ones instead and the owner was extremely nice and was able to get me the green ones. I love them! They're so shiny and comfy and make me feel like a mermaid! What more could you ask for?! ❤️❤️❤️
4580,"Absolutely stunning! I never want to take my mermaid attire off! Perfect fit, and fast shipping! Thank you for the magic!✨"
4581,"Love my bottoms! They came super fast, and I can't wait to wear them for Ultra Miami!!!"
4582,Very well made and adorable!! She was very easy to work with and was able to get my suit bottoms in time for a last minute vacation. Def will be ordering again .
4583,"These are AMAZING!!! Every man, woman, and child needs a pair of these pants! They are so comfy and stretchy.  I have mine on right now and I don't think I'll take them off.  I have yet to wear them in the water but I'm sure they'll be perfect.

Thanks guys!  I'll be back for more soon!!"

4601,"Good quality,  came fast. I'm very happy with it! Makes me anxious for summer to get here!"

4605,"Superb hand made crochet bra. well done,colour and shape are perfect!"
4606,love the unique design. fits well!
4607,Beautiful thank you so much
4608,Said it was a size large but it's more like a small A cup. Also the strings for the top and back are much thinner then in the pictures.
4609,My daughter ABSOLUTELY LOVED 😍 her tiktok swimsuit for her tiktok themed swimming party! Thank you!
4610,Hermoso traje de baño!
4611,So Cute 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘
4612,I ordered a size 9 for my daughter and it fit perfectly to the size. The material was really nice and smooth as well.
4613,Every thing was perfect
4614,Swimsuit came out great even though it was way oversized I had to make it work and hem it in. Order a size down for little ones.
4615,You will not be disappointed my trips loved it!!
4616,So fun!  Easy to order and amazing customer service!  Fast turnaround and great quality products!
4617,Loved them! Shipping was fast I will be shopping again!!

4619,Kudos to this vendor! Great quality
4620,Its cute and it was shipped within 2 or 3 days
4621,This skirt was perfect! Amazing quality! Seller was great to deal with. She kept her word with me and sent the skirt within the time I requested! Looked so cute on my daughter. Perfect for Wonder Woman Halloween costume.   Extremely satisfied in every way!!!
4622,You guys are awesome ^_^ I love this Wonder Women Bathing Suit and the matching for it and plus it fits perfectly I love it ^_^ Thank you so much

                                                   Thank you, Christy"

4628,Cute skirt!  Looked like it appeared in photo! Shipped very quickly!
4629,"Fantastic.  Ordered on Monday.  Received in CA on Friday.  Excellent customer service and made to my size, which is definitely on the plus side (both my size and as a bonus!).  Thank you!"
4630,This goes great with the Wonder Woman swimsuit.
4631,perfect!!

4633,This skirt is absolutely adorable!  The quality is great and I received it so quickly!  I would definitely order from this seller again and highly recommend this skirt :)
4634,"Loved my suit, wonderful transaction. i have a difficult time finding a suit that fits well because I am top heavy but small everywhere else. She was able to accommodate me and am very happy with the results."
4635,"Skirt was the perfect addition for the swimsuit. I cannot express how well made it is and how fast the shipping was. I hope to order from Kooj again, best Etsy service I've had so far."
4636,Sorry my review came late after having received my order! I am very happy with my purchase and it fits perfectly.
4637,super fast shipping and a quality piece. thank you for the great communication and unbelievably fast shipping. Great Seller!!!
4638,Completes the swimsuit. Fits great!
4639,It looks so cute in the picture and while it got to me in a timely fashion I did not open it I mailed it to my daughter as it was her birthday present. After she opened it she sent me pictures. While it does look adorable the workmanship was sloppy. The shirt has rough cut edges. They aren't finished edges and they weren't even cut even. I probably will not buy from her again.
4640,Fast shipping and a perfect fit!
4641,"Fantastic item, great seller and sent really quickly internationally, would definitely buy from again!"
4642,Loved it!!! Quick response and delivery. Thank you!
4643,"Wonderful skirt, and goes so well with the bathing suit!"
4644,Looks even better in person. Thankyou!
4645,bonne qualité la taille correspond expédition rapide
4646,Super fast shipping! Great item. Can't wait to wear. Thanks!
4647,Very cute and sexy. My wife loved it and looked great in this.
4648,"It was a little bigger and dark then I thought, but I still love it."
4649,Lovely! Will definitely be back for more.
4650,THANKS   Fast delivery   It's certainly bright!
4651,"In LOVE!  So well made- great fabric, great quality, SO CUTE, great service.  Very happy, will def be ordering more soon."
4652,"I had an ankle surgery last summer and since then have really been struggling with my body image (going from  a life of daily gym/swimming to not being able to walk unassisted for months) plus the pandemic making me a hermit I was looking for something that would boost my confidence. 
This bikini has done just that. It's so well made. We're hoping to book a holiday when things open up and I can't wait to show it off. Before buying this bikini I was going to insist on wearing baggy jumpers all day every day no matter what temperature it was outside. Thank you so much"
4653,"I bought two bikinis from this shop, and I don't know which one I love more. These are clearly better than any bathing suit I have ever owned. They get so many compliments and make me feel confident in my body. These pieces are instrumental to a Hot Girl Summer lookbook."
4654,"This is such a retro gem! I have not tried it on yet, because well I am in my pre bikini body blah blah blue... ha! However this seller is the sweetest and sent me my purchase in such a quick turn around. I can't wait to try this on as I see Cuba in my near vacay.... :>"
4655,Love this so so much! Fits perfectly and looks amazing on :)
4656,"Fits me beautifully and is super, super cute!! I can't wait to show this off around the pool!"
4657,This swimsuit is gorgeous! I absolutely love it! It's super comfy and I love how the top and bottom can come in different sizes! Thank you so much!
4658,"The item is slightly more orange than the photo and my photo doesn't exactly reflect the color, either. It is not a problem but just for information :)

The item is very well done and beutiful and stylish, maybe there could be less fabric inside the bra so it would be less bulky but it doesn't affect the way it looks.

Even the small is slightly big to me but I lost lots of weight nowadays and eventually I'll gain them back so this will be a good coverage bikini without being boring. True to size, I loved it!

Seller is friendly and has a great communication so I absolutely recommend both the seller and the item."
4659,"oh my god! this is definitely my dream bikini. i was worried it would be too tight, as so many swim suits are on me, but NO! it is SO COMFY and SO WELL MADE."
4660,My second swimsuit in this pattern! Love it!
4661,"Lovely, I love it. This is just what I wanted. Thank you. ♥"
4662,"so I feel like the top doesn't fit me as well as I wanted it to. But I looove the bottoms. Order a size up in the top. I am a 34d or 36c in bra size and the m was a little snug and i felt like i was going to have to be constantly pulling it up. Also the bow feels a little plasticy underneath the fabric and very flimsy and bendable. But the bikini itself is super cute, just be cautious when washing it!"
4663,"i recently gained thirty pounds after i quit smoking. i feel very unsure of my body now.  i was nervous to wear even a swim suit.  After i saw this one, i knew it was the suit i needed to get.  It was fun and playful.  when it arrived and i tried it on, immediately any doubt i had that i'd be able to wear it fell away.  this suit makes me feel really good about the way i look, it 'suits' my new shape perfectly! The owner was also honest about a defect she had detected when she was going to ship it out. she offered to make a whole new suit bottom or to give me a discount.  We decided on the discount.  I could only tell the defect when it arrived because she had pointed it out to me.  that really speaks to her quality control!  if you're on the fence about whether to buy from this seller, i'll tell you to buy! you won't regret it!"
4664,Super cute💕
4665,Super cute! And it fits me perfectly.
4666,"Love, adorable and fits great!"
4667,Only complaint is that the bow gets very floppy otherwise I absolutely love it!
4668,"Thank you so much, it's beautiful! Great customer service as well."
4669,"The bikinis are great quality and super cute, however once I tried on I felt I still wouldn’t have confidence to wear a bikini, the owner was great help and happily refunded me and was very understanding. Thankyou :)"
4670,Item is absolutely beautiful and looks amazing on! Can't wait to go for my holiday and get to wear it!
4671,Super comfortable and adorable bikini.
4672,"Quickly shipped, so beautiful, retro and gorgeous. I'm so delighted with this purchase!"
4673,"This bikini is so cute, fits well, and is very high quality!"
4674,Arrived in time and looks as described.   Beautiful design.   Material is a little thinner than I'd like but I know it's meant for the beach.  My kids have been stealing my sarongs which I use in the car or plane as a light blanket and shawl.  Now they'll get their own for Christmas with very cool prints!
4675,Love the print plus a good price at that and I really appreciated the fast shipping and thank you for the cute extra gift❤️
4676,"Arrived quick, the product is top notch and the size is great! Thank you for the free gifts!"
4677,The blue pareo I ordered as a gift is a lovely color and feels very nice. The woman to whom I gave it loved it!
4678,The fabric is stiff and not soft. I have bought better quality ones.
4679,"The Rashguard is awesome! I really love it :) 
It is really well made and Sandra is very friendly and helpful, she answered all the quenstions I had. She made my rashguard according to my measurements and it fits perfectly. 
She gave me recommendations on the colour and fabric and it came our totally gorgeous.
I already used it for wakeboarding and SUP and it is totally made for watersports, it dries fast and stays in place no matter what happens :D"
4680,"I’m so delighted with the quality of this piece, I want another!!!   Well made, perfect fit!!!   Highly recommend!!!"
4681,Well made. Fits well. Lined (so I don’t need to wear a top underneath). Easy to communicate with seller. Will definitely purchase more in future.
4682,"I’m super happy with this purchase, would definitely recommend!"
4683,"Très jolie tenue exactement comme sur la photo !!
Très girly j'adore ! !!"
4684,Had a custom size made. Great details with a perfect glove like fit. Love it!!
4685,The shipping time was remarkable. This outfit fits like a dream. She customized it to my measurements and it's really great quality. I have bought hundreds of outfits from retail stores and this outfit beats them all. I am going to buy all of my outfits from her from now on. :)
4686,Love it. Can't wait to wear it! I'm a little concerned about the bottom because it seems very fragile. It will be taken on and off constantly (obviously) and we will see if it can stand up to it without breaking. Other than that it's so cute!!!!!
4687,I love it! Fit perfectly
4688,"Got the wrong size but love it just the same, once I lose a few more inches I'll be rocking this beauty."
4689,"Love this suit!!!!! I ordered a custom version of this suit and the seller did not disappoint. Amazing communication and so willing to customize the suit to be how I envisioned it. I read all of the reviews that said these suits were amazing quality, but I assumed amazing-for-a-swimsuit quality, not better-than-most-of-the-clothes-I-wear-on-a-daily-basis quality. The material is sooo nice. I waited a little under two months from the time I ordered to the time I received my items (I ordered 3 suits total) and it was 100% worth the wait. Love love love my suit and can't wait to wear it!!!!!"
4690,"I ordered this beautiful suit and it came just in time for my vacation. It fits perfectly. She is such a doll and you can let her know whatever special requests or adjustments you need. Quality product, even more amazing store owner. Worth the buy!"
4691,Item was as described is a unique suit and fabulous color. The designer was an absolute dream to deal with!!!! Very responsive and helpful with all questions. I highly recommend doing business with this shop if you want a quality product provided by a professional person.

4694,"Loved the colour. Amazing fit & enjoyed the free gift attached :) 
Customer service's fantastic! 🌺"
4695,Very impressed with this suit top. Fits perfect and amazing quality. It is surprisingly comfortable and just simply stunning. Never seen anything like It. I anticipate many compliments.
4696,"I love this t-shirt!  I have worn it and slept in it and hated to go to work Monday because I had to take it off :-(  Cool artwork and comfy t, great shaping at the hem, too."
4697,"Wow, perfect fit! Love it 100%!!!"
4698,"Absolument magnifique, parfaitement taillé, et la matière est très douce. J'adore !"
4699,Great top. More t-shirt like than the other top I purchased. Looks great with jeans.
4700,"Nice. The fabric is good cotton, and the print is beautiful.
What's more, the package was sent as a thin envelope so that I should not have customs problems. Thank you, great work."
4701,beautiful bikini :) thank you for the beautiful little pouch for the bikini as well...
4702,"Very good quality, beautiful colors  and comfortable!"
4703,I loooove it I got exactly what I wanted and I knew when it was shipped and when I was gonna get it it’s good quality and deff will be buying more from y’all actually because of the COVID shit it was a lil longer wait but so worth it I recommend this to anyone for sure
4704,This bathing suit is so cute and fits so well!
4705,Love it!!
4706,LOVE IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE TOP WAS TOO SMALL AND THE BOTTOM TOO BIG SO IM GOING TO ORDER ANOTHER SET!!
4707,Fits true to size and great print quality
4708,As advertised and arrived quickly. Thank you!
4709,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM!!!!!Product is good quality. I reached out to order last minute for my daughters surprise 21st bday trip.  I got them within days. True fit. I'll definitely be ordering again!!
4710,I love how the swimsuit fits and it came through the mail really fast!
4711,I loved the quality.
4712,Fits very nice and is flattering. I normally do not wear one piece bathing suits as I have a longer torso and it tends to ride up but I did not have that issue with this suit. Can’t wait to wear it for my bachelorette party.
4713,Amazing quality and super fast delivery.
4714,Cute made well.  Came on time.
4715,"Perfect.
Amazing.
It fits as if it were made especially for me... and it was.
This is the last thing to check off on my home birth list and I couldn't be happier. 
Thank you. :)"
4716,"Awesome maternity/ nursing bra! I have to order a couple more so I’m not reusing the same one over and over again. Wore while I was In labor and now that I have my beautiful baby nursing, it’s the only bra I wear. I have other “traditional” nursing bras but my breasts have grown since my milk coming in and it’s the only bra that fits comfortably and incredibly easy to nurse with. Great bra!! Worth the money!"
4717,"Excellent product.  It's perfect especially for someone like me where I can never find the right size bra during my pregnancy. I look forward to using it as a bikini top, sports bra and nursing bra.  Super soft and high quality"
4718,"Beautiful, soft, and honestly one of the best nursing bras I've found."
4719,"Wunderschön, auch die Qualität scheint sehr gut zu sein. Genau nach dem ich gesucht habe."
4720,Very good quality and I really enjoy it. The only thing I'd recommend is getting a size bigger. The cup is a bit small. I'm a 32c and got a medium and would probably feel more comfortable in a large.
4721,"Due to COVID-19, the seller wasn't able to get the fabric they needed to make my order, but they were so helpful and gave me lots of different options to choose from. Great customer service and I appreciate them very much!!"
4722,"Due to covid, the owner was unable to get the fabric for my original order. However, she was very accommodating and considerate, and offered to send me a similar style top in the same color. I felt very taken care of, and I will absolutely be buying from this shop in the future."
4723,Very nice top! Fits like advertised and the seller was very good to work with.
4724,Great bikini! Feels great and the color is exactly like the picture!
4725,"Nice fabric, as described, fast shipping. Thanks!"
4726,"Nice fabric, as described, fast shipping. Thanks!"
4727,"Arrivato!!!! Bellissimo, fatto proprio bene, taglia perfetta!!!! Grazieeee!!!!"
4728,It fits amazing and it great quality.
4729,"When I received this in the mail I didn’t remember ordering it.
I pulled out a long single strip of cloth and thought to myself what in the world is this, this must’ve been a drunk purchase lol. 
I had to actually go on Etsy to look up what I bought...
After I figured out how to put it on I showed my husband and he loved it . 
I wore it to an all inclusive resort white theme party and it was a hit. It was absolutely stunning and I had all eyes on me . 
So glad I bought it !"
4730,"Makes a very nice shirt also! Use double stick tape on breasts so as not to accidentally expose nipples. Enjoy, love this, will shop here again."
4731,Definitely but this. Easiest stripper outfit ever to put on an sexy as f**k
4732,Great thanks. Recommend it. It longer longer than expected but nice product.
4733,"I'll say, I use etsy all the time and she definitely was the best customer service as far as going above and beyond sadly I did all of this for a pool party that was postponed lol but I can't wait to wear my bathing suit on the new day hopefully I can leave a picture than this was great service."
4734,"This suit fit perfectly and accentuated my shape, gave me curves I don’t even have 😂 very well made, made out of good material.. I will definitely order again!"
4735,I bought this for my wife for our vacation to Mexico. She looked incredibly sexy in it and it fit her perfectly!
4736,"I ordered the Baywatch in green. I tried it on and it fit amazing and was very well made. I can't wait to wear it on vacation. The customer service was excellent. Ashley was attentive and communicated with me constantly and answered my questions with no problem. She will definitely be my Go To for sexy, and great quality swimwear. 😁💕"
4737,Definitely worth every penny. The stitching is impeccable and the fabric is quality. What I like most is her customer service. I needed my suit last minute and she made it and shipped just in time!! This swimsuit is a head turner ladies
4738,Nothing but compliments on our suits! Thank you Thank you❤️
4739,Love the high cut!! Showed as pictured on model.. Great material!
4740,Cute! Perfect for frolicking around Malibu :)
4741,It shipped at good timing. Its a beautiful piece.
4742,"Very sexy! The only reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because I noticed that after jumping in the water, the bottom of the bikini thats covering your front, looked stretched out/worn out (as if it wasn't tight anymore) and you sort of have to stay on top of it so nothing shows down there. But prior to getting it wet I felt extremely comfortable in it and received many compliments!"
4743,"Great product, arrived in good time and with no issues, looks just like the picture. Would definitely recommend"
4744,Love it but the top is a little small but it's beautiful
4745,Cute suit. Fast arrival. Fits very well
4746,So cute. Tried it on and the material is really comfortable and flattering.
4747,"This swimsuit is so sexy! Shows off all your curves, I can't wait to wear it on vacation."
4748,"True to size, good quality. I love it"
4749,Well done>>>>> good fabric and the color very bright.
4750,Just too sexy. Highly recommended.
4751,Great material. Easy to purchase and ships fast!
4752,Awesome and efficient customer service
4753,"The actual bathing suits are great... if you can get the actual size. I am 5’5 and 120 lbs and never in my life have I ever had to buy a size large... nothing is wrong with wearing a size large but my concern is for humans who actually DO wear that size... what happens for them? They have to wear an XXL?? The vendor also wasn’t willing to ship me new sizes until I sent her the others, she did not cover the cost to send back (even though she sent me the wrong size after I gave her my measurements) all around it was not a good experience."
4754,Cute swimsuit but it's overpriced.
4755,Have not received my GF’s item in over 2 weeks after ordering. Valentines Day is over. We have already taken our trip. My request to cancel and receive a refund has been denied. Extremely disappointed.
4756,I fit 2 bikinis in this. Compact and perfect for travel
4757,Not exactly the color I expected/ordered but the item does what I need and came in a very timely manner!
4758,It is perfect! And shipped exactly when promised
4759,très bon produit... malgré une réception tres longue je recommande vivement ce produit très sexy
4760,really nice quality suit - the material is comfortable and it looks great.
4761,Seriously Sexy and very well made!
4762,Beautiful suit!
4763,"New favorite bikinis, thanks so much!"
4764,"Very nice, beautiful color and quick to ship."
4765,The stitching in the bottom for the scrunch butt is completely off. Not centred at all.  Not good.
4766,"I absolutely love this top, especially the print. I only wish you had a full coverage low rise bottom to match!! Its a gorgeous swim top. Cant wait to use it in Hawaii in 2.5 weeks!"
4767,Very pretty style in Millie! Luv the Agave Glow print! Size medium.
4768,Super comfortable and super cute! Love this designers suits. They have great support and the girls stay put. The color choices are awesome as is the fabric! Will be buying again for sure 💕👙
4769,"I'm in love with my new suit, the colors, the fit, and the fabric. I'll be back for another soon. Thank you!"
4770,This top is so cute and a nice spin on a simple top. Great support so there are no accidental slippage. This designer can be counted on for a consistent product every time. Thank me to order more!
4771,one of my favorite tops to wear
4772,"Super cute my daughters love and I received súper fast, definitely I recommend it."
4773,So cute! The number 5 that i got on the back couldve been a bit bigger but the seller didnt charge me extra to add it so im so appreciative. Thanks!
4774,Amazing service. I needed the pink Barbie bathing suit before a certain date and I received it with ample time. Great quality and the photoshoot came out great. Thank you so much again for your great customer service.
4775,"The suits are amazing! My daughter LOVED it for her seventh birthday, and the seller went above and beyond! Would definitely purchase again!"
4776,suits were exactly as i imagined! I even came back and ordered a third and seller was fantastic! had it out to me in 2 days!!!!!
4777,"Look the same than the web site, good fabric elastic, my daughter loved. I recommend it."
4778,"Good communication with sender, & fast delivery! I luv my girl personalized bathing suits!"
4779,Perfect!! Thanks!!
4780,Beautiful swimsuit. Good quality and received it just in time.
4781,Love it! Exactly that I wanted for my niece birthday gift !
4782,Great quality swimsuit! Just as described. Very happy customer. I recommend this shop!
4783,fantastic customer service and product was as expected
4784,Nice quality. Response was pretty quick. Love it
4785,Fast shipping and great quality!
4786,The size 5 T looks like a size 3T.  Very disappointed. Seller non-responsive.
4787,"I did not like the bathing suits at all. The bathing suits sizes were irregular. I ordered an adult small, which looks like a medium/large. The size for a 10yr old looks like an adult large. The size 5 looks like a size 3T. I'm waiting for the seller to rectify this issue."
4788,"Amazing seller and this designer did a flawless job on my custom order.  When asked if she could make the garment to measure and take away a tiny detail, she said yes without hesitation.  My model for my project looked stunning!!  Will definitely buy from this designer again."
4789,"Love this piece, super comfortable and fit perfectly"
4790,"Ausrie was awesome,quick replies,quick delivery,beautiful bodysuit
Very happy with my order"
4791,Love this swim suit! I've never felt so comfortable in one before because the suit designed to fit my body & not the other way around.  Super easy to follow the video to get the different styles & then play around from there.  I will absolutely buy more. Thanks!
4792,Great swimwear! Felt confident in it and haven't felt that good since before having children! My go to swimwear from now on!
4793,"Item arrived extremely quickly, 2 days. Zero issues and it came exactly as described. Very stretchy and cute. Definitely would buy from this seller again! Very professional and communicative; I would highly rate. Adorable suit<3"
4794,"This is my 4th swimsuit from her!!! The owner is amazing and i would recommend these suits to any woman who feels self conscious at the pool or beach, you will feel like a million bucks in this!"
4795,"This suit is great! I love it. I really like the variety of ways I can wear it, depending on my mood. It is fantastic for a changing postpartum body. Two months after giving birth, I felt comfortable enough to wear this suit. It hid my belly and  accentuated my legs. Again I love this suit!"
4796,This swimsuit is awesome! I've found many flattering ways to wear this!
4797,"Absolutely love it! The colors, design and material are all fabulous! Thank you SO MUCH!"
4798,everything is perfect!!! thank you..
4799,Super fast delivery! Thank you. : )
4800,"Love the fabric. Well-made, but runs VERY small. I'm 5'3, 118lbs and ordered a medium. It is too small, which is a shame. Gave it to my 12 year old daughter who's a size 00 and it was only slightly too big on her. Order up, way up. Otherwise, great suit."
4801,"Got to me very fast! 
But just know High cut, means VERY high cut! Haha! Thanks guys."
4802,"5’3 125 lbs (35; 27; 37) the medium fits perfect. Amazing customer service! I reached out to see if I could pay for fast shipping to get it before my trip and here it is ready to go! Thank you so much you saved me, lol."
4803,"The suit looked amazing on me, literally fit perfectly. I'm a curvier gal and I was so happy to find a shop that accommodates any size girl. I'm going on a bachelorette cruise party and all the girls got suits with sayings on them. This is literally the perfect suit and very flattering."
4804,"We had a pretty big order for  bachelorette party, with all different colors, fonts, and quotes- and PrettyRobesShop accommodated all of our requests and the bathing suits were super cute! They were shipped surprisingly fast."
4805,"Swimsuit ended up perfectly, and got to me in plenty of time! Thanks so much!"
4806,"I’m so happy with this swim suit! The material is really high quality, the cut is perfect- higher cut so it doesn’t construct your butt cheeks like some one pieces do, and the shipping was on time!"
4807,"The one piece is absolutely perfect! I’m beyond obsessed and can’t wait to wear it! Also, I got this item crazy fast, thank you!!"
4808,Hanna was spectacular! Customer service was out of the park. Great quality swimsuits and the customization! Would HIGHLY recommend!!
4809,"Shipped very fast, I ordered 13 bathing suits for a bachelorette party and they all came out perfect!"
4810,"Awesome customize swimsuits, ordered for a girls trip they did not disappoint, true to size & fast shipping will definitely order again & recommend their service without hesitation!"
4811,"I love it,it fits perfect,the writing is just the way i wanted and grear quality!(pic is in the mirror so it's backwards lol)"
4812,Sizing is about perfect. I weigh 120 5’3 and I ordered a small. Comes with nice built in pads too.
4813,"Love this swimsuit! Great quality, thick material. I personally love the cups (bonus), and this suit is NOT see through which is great since it is white. I also love the hi-cut style, very flattering. The seller was quick to respond to me with very cute options for the front (I got it for my bachelorette). Amazing item and customer service. Definitely would recommend."
4814,"This swimsuit came out perfectly!! The material is actually super high quality and I love that it has removable padding. The back is a low scoop which adds a bit of fun to a one piece. Highly recommend this shop, they were very patient in getting the wording and spacing correct through a few revisions of the artwork."
4815,Probably the best bathing suit quality I’ve ever purchased and the shipping was so fast!! Will definitely buy my custom suits here every year!
4816,"I am so pleased with the service provided and the quality of this bathing suit ! I ordered a size M and it is true to size. It is VERY high wasted so it shows a lot  of booty. 

Absolutely love this !!!"
4817,LOVE LOVE LOVE! Super cute baiting suits for my girls and I for a Bach party. The padding is an extra bonus💜💜💜 obsessed !
4818,My swimsuit was perfect. The design was beautiful and it was perfect fit. I ordered a small based on the size guide and it worked perfectly for me at 5ft 112lbs. It was a pleasure working with this seller. Will update my review with pics later.
4819,"Great quality product. Impressed with the tight pull on the material. Hi cut and comes up high on the back,so it's a flattering fit. Seller easy to communicate with to get it just how you want it. Surprised friends for our Girls Trip and they were a big hit! I ordered mine first to get a feel for the other sizes. In short, get your regular size!! Red and Rose Gold are Medium and Yellow/Green/Blue are Large. I'm in yellow and 180lbs and size 12/14 and large was perfect. Almost felt like I could've gotten the medium for a tighter snatched look,but that very well may have been pushing it. LOL Anyway,don't hesitate♥️"
4820,"This turned out perfect! I am usually a s/m, but decided to go with small because I am flat chested. The small fit great!"
4821,"Gorgeous! They are great quality, the colors are so bright and beautiful. Couldn’t have been any happier."
4822,"Super cute! But heads up, it runs small! Just for reference, I ordered a L and am 5’8 & 152lbs and it riiiiiides up. Not sure if an XL would work or not since I’m worried it prob would’ve been too large. But maybe just be cautious if you’re tall. Overall, the material is good and the communication with the seller was great!"
4823,Definitely recommend! Fit so perfectly and it was so comfortable. I love the one piece aspect and the straps stayed up on my shoulders well.
4824,Perfect fit
4825,"PrettyRobesShop is amazing! They were fast, professional, and answered every question/change I had. The swimsuits arrived much fast than anticipated and the quality, font, and colors are perfect. Thank you!"
4826,"Customer service was great, order got here in time! Lastly, the bride loved both of her suits! The fit is perfect!! Go one size up cause they do run small."
4827,"Thankful for this company!
Loved my bathing suit"
4828,"Love the bathing suit! Thank you! I was able to get exactly what I want printed on the bathing suit (wording and font). The only thing is I wish I had sized up. The bathing suit fits but it’s not as comfortable as I would like. I would recommending sizing up, especially if you’re tall. I’m not even tall (5’ 2”) and a small feels as if it’s stretching to fit my height."
4829,We love our suits! They look just like the picture.
4830,"This was an awesome purchase. They are so helpful if you need assistance and my suit got here so quick! It’s really good quality as well. If you’re looking for a fun custom swim suit, I highly recommend this shop!"
4831,Seller was super responsive and sweet! I love the suits too. I got them in rose gold and they’re cute and flattering!
4832,Great suit! The seller was super responsive and made the design exactly how I requested it. The suit is super cute and not see-thru. Can’t wait for my bachelorette!
4833,Love it!!!
4834,"Very helpful with quick delivery. I would say size up in swim in you have a bigger chest. I am a 34DDD and ordered a large, but definitely could’ve used a XL for the breast area."
4835,Exactly what I requested for my baby moon! Quick shipping!
4836,The swimsuit it’s self fits perfect and good quality. But this is a customized item and my text is off center which looks - odd
4837,"Definitely high cut on the sides, in the front and in the back, BUT very well made, high quality and shipping was fast! Communication was very good in getting these custom made, quick and thorough responses. I was afraid they would be cheaply made and I would be falling out of it, but everything stays in its place!"
4838,I ordered 6 bathing suits for my best friends bachelorette and I’m in love ! Good material and they arrived so quickly. Thank you Hannah and Leonie! Will definitely order again
4839,Loved them! Thank you..can't wait to use them at my bachelorette party!
4840,"Super cute, super high cut!"
4841,"I love this shop! They were great and executed exactly what I wanted, the quality of these suits surpasses others I've found online. Would purchase again from here."
4842,"I love this shop! They were great and executed exactly what I wanted, the quality of these suits surpasses others I've found online. Would purchase again from here."
4843,"I love this shop! They were great and executed exactly what I wanted, the quality of these suits surpasses others I've found online. Would purchase again from here."
4844,They all turned out great. Get your normal size. Letters stayed on well too
4845,"Customer service is great!! 
The fit of the bathing suit is on point (go one size up) 
Lastly, the customizable lettering I loveeee! I will come back to add pictures once the bride has it on. :) 
Thank you so much!"
4846,Shipped really fast and were so fun for my friend's bachelorette!!
4847,I LOVE this suit! Great quality and the company was very quick to respond on any questions I had! Definitely recommend :)
4848,The suit is absolutely adorable and exactly what I was expecting!
4849,Great fit and so happy I could get my friends company logo!!
4850,"Shipping and customer support were great. When I received my suit, the font was way bigger than I expected, maybe because I only had one short word. It is fine, but a digital proof may have helped that. 
I think the suit is probably best for those with larger chests - I am a small b cup but there is gaping on the sides near the armpit. I am 5'2 and ordered a size small, which fits great in all other areas.
All in all, get's the job done for a $20 one piece!"
4851,Great order 😊 They were speedy and detail oriented. I will say sizing was tricky with this. Online I should be a size M but ordered a L just to be safe. Ended up being just about right. So I’d say error on the bigger size side. I’m typically a 6 in my bottom half and I wear a 36 C.
4852,"GREAT PURCHASE 💕 These are surprise gifts for my sisters and they came out perfect. The shop owners are amazing, I accidentally forgot to change the delivery address when I changed my payment methods AND THEY WERE GOING TO GET SHIPPED TO ONE OF MY SISTERS! The shop was quick to respond and made sure the change was made, life savers!"
4853,"GREAT PURCHASE 💕 These are surprise gifts for my sisters and they came out perfect.

4854,Perfect for my birthday party! Was able to get rush shipping so it would come in time for the big day. Great customer service and great product.
4855,"Good communication skills,very professional,good service.I love it!!!! Thank ya'll so much.."
4856,Loved this suit! Looks great and fits well. A good quality suit and well worth the price.
4857,"Swimsuits look and fit as true to size.  However, after the first time wearing the swimsuit the words crack and started to peel on some of the swimsuits."
4858,"Ordered for my upcoming bachelorette party. Shop was very responsive and the product shipped quickly! Very cute and good quality. Would recommend sizing up, especially if you are on the taller side."
4859,Excellent quality and great seller! It even has cups inside!!
4860,Swimsuit looks great! But warn that transparency over accurate shipping times is quite poor (this was ordered several weeks before the current health crisis as a disclaimer).
4861,fits like a glove...high quality swim suit and lettering...love it!!!
4862,Quality suits but I recommend to SIZE UP!  We ordered 8 suits and followed the size chart exactly. The shop followed up with me quickly and resolved the issue. I would order from this shop in the future. Quality suits and service!
4863,Super cute. High cut and looks just like the picture
4864,Love the suit and quick response. I will say the white I got for my bachelorette isn’t lined in the bottom so I think I’ll have to line it myself. Not an issue with the shop but something to think about if you’re getting a light color. I’ll be updating with pictures of me and my cute bridesmaids soon!
4865,"Ordered a set of swimsuits for a bachelorette party and everything turned out well. Great quality and really pleased with customer service as well. 

I would also size up for a better fit."
4866,Loved it!! Was exactly what I wanted!
4867,Shipped SOOO fast and was exactly what I expected!
4868,"Have not worn it in the water yet, which is why I gave 4 stars. Shipped very quickly. The shop owner stayed in communication. No complaints"
4869,Loved it. Very flattering on a body that I'm not always crazy to show off.
4870,"Great quality suit, very vibrant hot pink!"
4871,Love the fit and lettering
4872,Great quality swimsuit! The turnaround time was quick.
4873,Haven’t tried it on yet but I am obsessed!!!!!
4874,This is my second custom swimsuit order and it’s just as great as the first. Fit and quality is consistent!
4875,Seller was very friendly. Shipped fast. Great material
4876,"Quick shipping, exsctly what i was looking for! Loved the bright colors, too"
4877,LOVE my swimsuit- it turned out exactly as I hoped. Very friendly and responsive to my questions before I even placed the order.
4878,"Great quality, I just wish the text was a little higher as it hits where my stomach is instead of my chest."
4879,"Bathing suits were as described. The yellow color is more golden, which I liked. From time I placed my order to time of delivery, it took about 3 weeks. I would order again."
4880,"Ordered a “fiancé” suit to wear on a trip. Came in super quick, just in time!! But it came in saying “fiancée” instead of “fiancé” so I message the shop about my situation, thinking oh well innocent mistake I’ll get another. They offer me 20% refund and gave me googled definitions of the words fiancé and fiancée... It doesn’t matter what Google says the definition is? I ordered a personalized suit that specifically said “fiancé”.  So to the other fiancé’s, I would support a different business to get your suits. This one may make unwanted changes to your order and be difficult."
4881,Very nice quality!! She loves it
4882,"This item was great for the purpose. We got them for my friend’s bachelorette. It shipped in about 2 weeks, which I accounted for so that was fine. The only reason I am not giving this suit 5 stars is because the letters were threatening to peel off right when I took it out of the box (they didn’t, though) and the sizing was difficult to decipher what size would be best for me. I am between a small and a medium and I ordered the small but it just made the cut. It was also super cheeky but hey, it was a bachelorette!"
4883,"It was okay, customer service not that responsive, messaged a few times a week before I needed to use the bathing for a bachelorette to see if they could mail it earlier, the night before I needed is is when I got a response and they sent it fedex one day, the package got to my house while I was on the boat for the bachelorette. Would have been nice if they just did that a day earlier. Now the bathing suit is it’s sitting in my closet, unworn. $30 down the drain."
4884,Very happy with the customer service and product !
4885,"They are perfect, thank you!"
4886,Love the fit. Very comfortable
4887,Very happy with my purchase!
4888,True fit and was delivered on time!
4889,"Letters began to peel off after wearing the bathing suit for less than half a day, and not even going in the water!! Very disappointed. It was ordered for a bachelorette and in the pictures my bathing suits letters are hanging on by a thread. I definitely had higher expectations"
4890,Delivered quickly and great quality!
4891,Before purchasing make sure you review the color on the picture/icon. Do not go by the name. I ordered a Light Pink but the color of the suit is identical to the picture. So not L.Pink. Swimsuit Size Chart is true to the size.
4892,These swimsuits were beautiful and my sisters loved them as a great surprised. Only issue is there were very big on us. Wish I would of gotten smaller sizes.
4893,Arrived exactly as described! Thank you!
4894,"The first order I got was incorrect - said they couldn’t do multiple colors and then did, and didn’t even put color we had discussed. However, they kindly redid my order and sent the suit corrected. A couple things to note: the letters were not completely centered - off to one side a little, letters still look a little messed up in some places (I asked for this to be addressed from first suit too), and it is a white one-piece swimsuit with no liner in the bottom area, if you know what I mean. Sadly, I don’t think I would do this through this company again, though customer service and offer to correct was appreciated. It’s attention to detail and quality product that would keep me coming back. Thanks!"
4895,Arrived quickly and as described.
4896,"Ordered the product on feb 15. I had to email the company in order to get the product ship after waiting over three weeks. Tried to get a refund but they shipped the product after I sent three emails, ironically. The product came and it looks good. I would just be concerned about the long shipping wait."
4897,"I was very disappointed with this shop. I ordered swimsuits July 17. The shop did not reply for 1 week regarding rush shipping, I paid for it then never heard from the shop. The rush shipping date came and went (August 1). Ultimately I heard from the shop August 6, apparently ‘new employees made mistakes’ and they overnighted my item. Received my item on August 8, 1 week after I had wanted the items. Swimsuits are really cute, love the padding. Had some weird marks on them after getting wet/ drying. But most came out after hand washing.  I will say they refunded my rush shipping but I will never order from this shop again."
4898,"The swimsuit is cute and fits well. However, the letters were falling off when I received it. I messaged the company with frustrations regarding my order and have yet to hear back to resolve the issue."
4899,"I ordered this for a bachelorette party. According to the size chart I’m a medium but I sized up to large based on reviews. When I got and tried it on it was so short. Definitely could have used a XL just for length and I don’t have a long torso. Also, half of the letters were peeling off. I contacted the seller and they sent a response telling me to fix it with a towel and iron. When I told them I didn’t have an iron I asked if they could send me a new one in an XL and I would be happy to send the L back. They didn’t respond but sent me a new one but sent the same size L. When I received it once again half the letters are peeling off.  My friend ordered one too black with white letters and they sent her black with gold letters and the letters are peeling off of hers too."
4900,"ordered this bathing suit for my bachelorette party, good quality material, but unfortunately the sizing was not good, too tight for me, and since it was special ordered, I was unable to return/exchange for larger size, so it was a big waste of money for me. And I will now have to figure out a new solution.  Very disappointed. 

Also, lettering was already falling off as soon as I opened. So lettering would have probably fallen off completely once worn in water :/"
4901,"Never received my item. Messaged multiple times and received one response that said they would TRY to get it to me on time....which would be a month and a half after I ordered originally. Ordered with 6-8 other people who didn’t seem to have a problem, so not sure why I’m having such an issue. I personally would try to rush someone’s order who has been waiting a month and needs it by a certain date."
4902,"Unprofessional. My bridesmaids and I ordered these suits for my bachelorette trip. 4 of them ordered their suits a week before me, and they still have not received it, yet I have received mine. Suits were supposed to ship 2 weeks ago. The seller did not contact anyone telling them about a delay. Everyone tried to contact the seller, but got no response. The seller finally started answering once cases were opened against the shop. Don't order from here if you need something by a certain date. You most likely wont get it, or get a response."
4903,I am absolutely in LOVE with this suit. The seller was also amazing. She let me know as soon as it restocked and shipped it out THE day I ordered! Thank you so much. The suit is beautiful and I get endless compliments on it. I will definitely be back for more. For references this suit is a size LARGE and I weigh 160. It fits perfect
4904,Love Bikiniboo swimsuits so much! Always perfect and Kerry is just wonderful. Can’t wait to treat myself again next year! Xx
4905,"I asked for a custom back, more cheeky, Italian style and the seller was just top notch in everything! She designed a few types and showed me before the finalized one. When I got it in the mail and put it on I literally did a happy dance! The sewing details were great. Love love love my suit!"
4906,"So many compliments!! 5'7 145#, 34B. Considering ordering my next one size medium (this is a large). Love it!!"
4907,This is my favorite bathing suit I have ever worn! I feel so great in it. I highly recommend a purchase for a classic vintage sexy look!
4908,I love this swimsuit! It fits my body so well and is so flattering. I can't get over how great the fit it. So cute.
4909,I got two pairs of swimmers and I absolutely love them!! I’ve never felt so confident in swim wear before. But these are super adorable and feel comfortable and sturdy yet appearing feminine and sexy. I got a one piece and a bikini and they fit really well. I have small /non existent boobs but I’m tall and do have broad shoulders and yet the top still actually fits me really well! That’s hard to find! Love it. I wish I had more excuses to wear them!
4910,"The bathing suit is well made and fits really well. It was shipped on time as well. The only issue is that I am not a very busty woman so for the halter to stay in place on my breasts, I needed some waterproof fashion tape. Other than that, the suit is gorgeous!"
4911,I would like to thank Kerry for an awesome buying experience .. She was so kind and friendly .. The swimsuit is perfect .. I actually bought two from her for my honeymoon .. They're as described and perfect fit .. I just LOVE them 😭😭😭
4912,So perfect. I bought this three days before leaving for the Dominican Republic and it arrived with time to spare. Great fit and keeps its shape. I was worried it might not stay in place while swimming but it kept everything where it should be. Thank you so much
4913,"I got the small and didn't realize this shop is in England so I was worried it wouldn't fit. But it fit perfectly! Way more boob exposure than I thought, but hey. It looks great! Very chic."
4914,"Kerry was completely awesome! The swimsuit is amazing - GREAT quality, fabric, and design! I cannot wait to wear it on my honeymoon!! Thanks again!!"
4915,"I love my swimsuit! It's comfortable, adjustable, and fun. Kerry was really helpful in customizing the size for me so it fit just right! She's a pleasure to work with."
4916,"I don't think I've ever felt so good about my body in a bathing suit. I love it, thank you💛"
4917,"Well made, measurements true to description, and shipped perfectly! Contacted seller about time sensitivity, and the shipping she recommended got my item to my house on time! Excellent! I won't be buying bathing suits from anywhere else ever again!"
4918,Fantastic swimsuit!! Love love love. It’s guna be my go-to this summer! So far I’ve been wearing it as a top with high waisted shorts and skirts. Xoxo
4919,"LOVE this shop and its maker! Super happy with the suit - & i have recommended this shop to multiple people since I purchased mine. Fits well, very flattering, comfy and so fun (though I am busty so to my fellow large-chested lady friends - just be careful as the 1-pieces may be more suited for laying out and lounging as opposed to something more aggressive like beach-volleyball ;)). I will be ordering multiple more.

PS - swift delivery and great correspondence from designer/seller. So sweet and accommodating! :)"
4920,I love it! It fits perfectly and is so cute. The seller was very polite and I received it very quickly. I can't wait to wear it when I go on my honeymoon!
4921,Love this swimming suit.
4922,"Beautiful, I love the pattern and the suit is sexy. It does not provide me a ton of support and I do have to be careful they stay in even though I tie it tight. I do have an area where a little hole started in a seam. I probably pulled on it too hard."
4923,Love this suit!  Came super fast from the IK and it is very flattering on!
4924,Such a cute swimsuit! I love the fit and look of this and the store owners are incredibly friendly and helpful. great store!
4925,"super cute. Love the vintage look. A small fits me perfectly, I'm 5/3 118lbs. A-cup. The top doesn't stay put as well as I'd like it to, but lets face it, if you're wearing this its not because you want to be active all day."
4926,Love this suit! I even wear it under my high waisted shorts as a top sometimes!
4927,"Such a lovely swimsuit that strikes the perfect balance between classy and flirty. I'm small chested (32B/34A) and I find the top really comfy-- kind of removes the pressure/focus from the bust, to the open back. Can't wait to wear it on my honeymoon in June!"
4928,I absolutely loved my swimsuit!! Shipping was pretty fast and the swimsuit looks exactly like the picture. I'll post a photo of me in the swimsuit whenever I head to the beach!! Kerry is very professional and always willing to answer any questions you may have. I'll definitely purchase from bikini boo again!!
4929,love love love it :)
4930,Shop owner was quick to respond to my message and the suit is adorable!! Thank you!
4931,Fits great. Flattering. Not enough peat as I'd like.
4932,Very cute on!! Flattering perfect for Miami bachelorette party.
4933,Gorgeous. Super happy with my purchase. Thank you!
4934,"Lovely pattern, well made. Can’t wait to use it!"
4935,Great swimsuit! Excellent communication from seller!
4936,"I LOVE my bottoms!! Definitely take your measurements to make sure that it fits correctly. I am 150, 5'3, and wear a size 8 in jeans. I ordered large. I would recommend these to anyone and eventually I hope I have these bottoms in every color."
4937,Absolutely fantastic! Perfect fit! And feels great! I have been wanting this style forever! Thank you so much!! :)
4938,LOVE THEM PERFECT FIT THANKS!!!!!!!
4939,lovee
4940,Fit perfectly and was exactly what I wanted
4941,"I ordered 2 pieces from this shop and I looooove them both!!
Awesome fit and great quality.  Just placed an order for three more pieces.  Owner asks for your measurements to make sure item fits well.  Set for the summer!"
4942,"Amazing service- fast shipping, careful packaging, and I mean come on this babe is some kind of goddess at creating swimsuits. SO happy. Thank you thank you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
4943,"I love these swimsuit bottoms!! They look just like the picture. They're high quality and the color is beautiful. My only complaint would be that the crotch area is far too wide and it looks a bit uncomfortable in that area. The extra fabric makes it a little unflattering. But if you pull it up a little higher, it's not as bad. Overall, I would suggest this store to a friend! Thank you!"
4944,"Nice fit, very lovely"
4945,"Looks great, came right on time.  It does bunch up in your butt a little bit, but it's not a big problem."
4946,One of several transactions.  All flawless
4947,"Bathing suit arrived so fast, my bride was very happy with the results and it fit perfectly. Thanks for such a quick turnaround. It was a perfect addition to our Bachlorette party in Miami."
4948,Loved the bathing suit!
4949,LOVE IT!!
4950,I ordered a white one for my bachelorette party and it said “final fiest” it was comfy and true to size!!
4951,Great fit and perfect sizing! Size small and wear a small. True to size
4952,Sizing guide was accurate and fit as described/ true to size!
4953,Good for the price
4954,"Sizing was off. It didn't work for my body. I'm 5'9"", so I think it may work better for shorter girls."
4955,Poor service. Poor quality suit.
4956,Horrible quality. Is very thin and see through. I contacted the shop about returning it since my item had not been personalized and they refused to do so. Bad quality and bad costumer service. Do not recommend them.
4957,"I wore this gorgeous cape as part of a peacock costume for my birthday and it was an absolute HIT! Everyone couldn't stop raving about it. Beautifully crafted, light and delicate, it was such a great addition to my costume!"
4958,This cape is beautiful and striking.  I wore it with a green velvet dress and a lace mask.  It made a perfectly elegant Halloween costume.  Thank you!
4959,Oh my God I’m sooo in love with my cape thank you
4960,"This cape is absolutely exquisite, and I was the talk of the gala I wore it to last night!  Wonderful communication, super fast shipping, and a gorgeous work of art I can wear for years to come!  Thank you so much! ♡"
4961,It is magic!  We adore this cape.
4962,Absolutely in love with all the beautiful pieces from Costurero Real. My new favorite store. ❤️
4963,This cape was even more gorgeous in person than in the photos! And the fabric is so light and smooth that it feels wonderful when you wear it. It's my favorite thing in my closet now!
4964,"I love this beautiful cape! It maybe seemed a little expensive for what it is, but it's a unique product and the colors are rich on the printed side. I hope to find more reasons to wear it!"
4965,it came in a week! and it's perfect
4966,"très jolie bien que plus petite que je ne le pensais. Attention colis arrivé abîmé. Dommage, la boite était très jolie mais mal protégée ! Very nice but smaller than I think. 
ATTENTION ! the package was damaged"
4967,This cape took my breath away! 😍 Amazing quality and beautifully packaged.
4968,So gorgeous! Titania in our outdoor production of Midsummer was radiant in this cape.
4969,Absolutely stunning! It has a gorgeous feel and looks amazing. Very happy with this.
4970,"As was the case with the previous capes you made for us, these are stunning!  The peacock tail is really captured in the design and the movement of the chiffon is perfect.  Thanks for adding wires to the edging as that makes it so much fun to move with the capes floating out around us.  

It is such a pleasure to work with you.  You are so wonderfully responsive and so quick with your replies and with shipping.  Thank you!!"
4971,Gorgeous
4972,It arrived so fast. Absolutely stunning. I will purchase from this company again. Amazing customer service
4973,"This scarf is very beautiful and Sofia is such a lovely person! I highly recommend this store and these lovely cloaks - I don't want to miss it, thank you! :-)"
4974,It took longer to ship but the merchant communicated the reason. This is absolutely beautiful and I get lots of compliments on it.
4975,So Beautiful. Thank you!
4976,This is gorgeous. I was dumb and picked the wrong address and they responded quickly to my mistake. Thank you so much. Great customer service.
4977,As described
4978,Extremely fast shipping and excellent quality. Highly recommend!
4979,This cape is beautiful and striking.  I wore it with a green velvet dress and a lace mask.  It made a perfectly elegant Halloween costume.  Thank you!
4980,"Lovely item , quite thin but what i wanted in case Asylum is as hot as it was this year!"
4981,"Absolutely fantastic, it looks so beautiful in person!!"
4982,Thank you! Beautiful! I like it a lot
4983,Amazing design and craftsmanship. Could not recommend more. Simply beautiful.
4984,"Wow -- this order arrived fast!  I won't actually be wearing it, but plan to use for photo shoots.  The quality is great, I wish it would have arrived with some recommended washing instructions (in case they're ever needed).  Overall, I am very pleased with this order.  Thank you!"
4985,Superb.  This was a gift for my wife to be used for free dancing and she absolutely adores it. Thank you so much.
4986,What a dreamy cloak!  It's just perfect.
4987,"A beautiful print on lightweight fabric. The print looks like a liquified photo, which gives it a realistic yet surreal look. It is huge, but duo to the thin frabric, doesn't need much space. My only issue is that you can see a bit of a line in the middle of the print, where the print seems to be cut together or mirrored, which is why it's only 4 stars. Otherwise, it's gorgeous!"
4988,A lovely cape that really makes an impact.  Gorgeous!
4989,"Lovely item , quite thin but what i wanted in case Asylum is as hot as it was this year!"
4990,Just as beautiful in real life as in the pictures.  Came super fast too!
4991,"I love the design, but it is over priced for the types of fabric and finish of the product."
4992,This is unique and incredibly beautiful.
4993,Everything I hoped for and more!!
4994,Very good fabric and really beautiful!
4995,Gorgeous as always!  Thanks for the lovely gift!!!!
4996,Such a beautiful cape. rich colors. Great seller.
4997,Extremely fast shipping and excellent quality. Highly recommend!
4998,I’m so sorry to say anything negative because the owner was so kind and accommodating. However sometimes things just look much better in pictures and this was one of those times. The Peacock cape does not look like anything special and I am a dancer able to make it move and flow and it still does not seem to give off the extravagant look as the picture suggests . I would order from her again as she really was very  helpful and maybe it is just my taste that does not care for this particular item I costume throughout the year with many different events and this was just not a showstopper like I thought it would be . ☹️
4999,Like the design and colors of this fabric. Well done. Love it.
5000,"This peacock cloak looks so amazing! Shipping was fast, highly recommended."
5001,Item is as described and will be perfect for my use!!! Highly recommended vendor on all fronts!!
5002,"I have been wearing this around the house!  Definitely a pick me up in this dreadful year

Kathryn"
5003,"Wie abgebildet, sehr schön und sorgsam verpackt."
5004,Love it! Responded immediately to the order and received it in no time.
5005,Absolutely lovely cloak. First class seller with great communication and customer service. 100% recommended!
5006,"Fast shipping. Lovely fabric, floaty and nice colour per the listing photos - can't wait to wear :)"
5007,Everyone who sees this wants one!
5008,"I expected more based upon the cost.  The ""scarf"" is  very sheer, likely rayon, but there is no content tag, so I'm only guessing; it is similar to a rayon kimono I bought for $20 in weight and quality.  Although a others have said, the pattern is nice, and I agree, the sheerness takes away from the vibrancy.  It is a foot shorter than I would have guessed from the photo.  I am 5'5"" and when on my shoulders the drop reaches my calves (about 54"").  There is no tailoring, The cape is literally a hemmed 1/2 circle.  no clasp or buttons.  It has two, 36"" green ribbons, spaced approx 24 inches  apart from center back, sewn to hem edge for closure.  Nothing wrong with any of the construction, I'm just wondering why it cost so much."
5009,Wow this is really fun. I have a friend who is so going to enjoy wearing this as the peacock queen for Halloween.
5010,As described
5011,Beautiful! Can’t wait to wear it!
5012,Arrived on time. Very beautiful.
5013,It is so lovely! I can't wait to wear it.
5014,"Just lovely! I haven’t unwrapped it yet, as it is a present. But it looks just beautiful and I can’t wait for my sister to receive it on Christmas Eve."
5015,"Just as pictured, thank you!"
5016,"The material look realy cheep and the backside is not verry flatering så cant wear it like a big scarf.
Not worth it, not ""silky"" at all. I would like a picture at its backside."
5017,Excellent transaction
5018,My absolute fav bikini guru!  She makes good quality for reasonable prices.
5019,My second time using her.  Quick turn around easy to communicate customization.
5020,Very pleased! Will order again

5028,my favorite piece of all.
5029,"Customer service was amazing, very cooperative and helpful . Bathing suit is just as beautiful as it looks in pictures . Ecstatic"
5030,I absolutely love this and have worn it around the pool at home.  It looks great!
5031,Perfect size fits well. Fast processing and delivery time. High quality rhinestones don't fall off. Worn in the water as well during vacation. Definitely recommend this product!
5032,I have been looking for cute thong bottoms I can wear at the strip club. I am a petite girl and ordered xs and it fits perfect! Fast shipping and processing. Definitely will be ordering more.Can’t wait to wear!

5048,"I was a little ify about how it would fit, as I do not look anything like the models but it fit fantastic!! It's a stretchy material so it forms to your own curves, I was also worried about the breast area and if it would make my boobs look flat but again its very stretchy and fit amazingly. THANKS
*definitely recommend this item and seller*"
5049,This monokini is PERFECT. It's my second bathing suit I've ordered from here in a short amount of time. I can't believe how flattering these suits are. Already scoping out the next order.

I live on a boat so a bikini is a must, and I'm a mommy so I'm really going outside my comfort zone hahah and never buy myself anything... I mentioned to the shop owner that it hadn't come yet and she promptly and politely let me know that she would send another! Such a nice gesture and I will be recommending this shop to all of my friends :)"

5083,Great quality. Bottoms are a little funky.
5084,Palm Springs perfection! BS was so helpful to get my custom suit delivered in time for my trip. Fit perfect and SO SO many compliments at the pool that weekend! Xo!
5085,"I never thought I'd dare to wear a thong swimsuit in public, until I found this. It fits perfectly and I feel sexy and boho classy in it. Epic piece."
5086,"Absolutely amazing baiting suit! Very sexy! I will definitely order again and if you’re dubious, don’t be! You will love it! I am pretty difficult to impress and I was definitely impressed. The only thing is I had an extra layer added in the groin area to prevent it from riding up in the front (this happens with all thong bathing suits and I’m sure if I had requested Breezy would have done it for me). Photos don’t do it justice!"
5087,"Breezie is AMAZING! This seller made sure that my purchasing process was as easy as possible, she was quick to respond to my many questions about the item. The suit was customized exactly how I asked and I could not be happier with my purchase, the material and color is amazing, this suit its worth every penny! Not only is the quality and customer service flawless, but she even had it shipped to me (across country) on time for my trip, best online shopping experience ever. She helped me with my sizing, I'm 5'6', athletic, 125 lbs, small chest/waist, big booty, long torso, I got a small and fits perfectly. She also writes you a personalized note with the shipment, which I enjoyed that extra personal touch! Can't wait to wear it on vacay!"
5088,"Customer service was awesome and my swimsuit is of excellent quality and fits perfectly. I’m 5’10, dress size 8, ordered a large."
5089,I love it!!!!!!!!
5090,"It is exactly what I wanted, fits perfectly and is a huge hit."
5091,Love my new swimsuit!  The quality is great and looks just as pictured.  Great communication and customer service from the seller -- would definitely buy from again :)
5092,The seller was so so helpful as I had a time crunch and the bathings suit was absolutely adorable and what I expected when it arrived! Would definitely buy again!
5093,"Super friendly, accommodating, and took notes/custom requests really well.  Made a custom swimsuit for my wife and it worked out really well/looks great."
5094,I LOVE THIS SUIT. BREEZIE has been so helpful she has altered and customized exactly how I wanted things. It's going to be LIT this SUMMER.
5095,"Love this suit! Amazing quality, fits perfectly, and the material is nice and thick so it really sucks you in. I will absolutely order from again. Thank you!!"
5096,Beautifully crafted suit! Fast turn around for a handmade item. Really excited to wear it!!
5097,"Very nice item and it got here very quick. The pattern has been changed on my request and oh it worked out great, the amount of cheeky is perfect.
Not my last purchase ♡"
5098,"Fits like a glove! Love it! Can’t wait to wear to the hot tub and the beach, also going to use this for a Halloween costume. Definitely will buy more!"
5099,LOVE this piece! It fits me perfectly. Really unique design. Loved wearing it at Burning Man and other events this year. Thanks!
5100,"I haven't worn a bathing suit in years, in part because I can't find anything that looks flattering without being two pieces. Not only is this swimsuit minimal, stylish and well-made, but it fits like a glove and could flatter any body type. Thank you for a quality item!!"
5101,"definitely my favourite swimsuit i've ever owned. moriah was very accommodating, too: she rushed both the production and the shipping, and i had my suit in time for a special occasion. thank you so much!"
5102,"Lovely, original work and it looks and feels fantastic! ^_^"
5103,"What a cool suit! Nothing out there like it, and it really works on the body. Sexy, yet almost modest too."
5104,I got my red bikini. Absolutely gorgeous! Amazing quality! Fits perfectly. I'm ordering every color. I'm obsessed. Thanks so much! Heather 😊
5105,"Shipped quickly, great product, a little price-y but it's perfect for summer"
5106,I was soooooo excited and purchased based off sizing on site... the top was waaaaaay too small. I the bottoms were cute tho. I basically just put it in the drawer and forgot about it until I was asked to review it. I’m bummed because I have been hunting for a cute red bikini for years. :(
5107,"Sent the wrong size. Ordered a Large, received a S/M.  A friend is taking that one, so it's working out."
5108,"I love this bathing suit. 1st one of bought in 6 years and it's perfect for my body. So happy they let me get a different size for the bottoms and top otherwise I wouldnt have bought. The quality is strong and very, very nice. My boyfriend absolutely loves it. We are going to the Virgin Islands in this bathing suit. I"
5109,"LOVE LOVE LOVE ENEZ SWIMWEAR! I've bought 4 suits so far, and plan on buying more! Amazing customer service, great communication, high quality material, PERFECT FIT! #EnezAddict 💯❤️"
5110,"Shipped on time and fit as expected, quality material. She loved it."
5111,I can't even express the love I have for these beautiful high waist bottoms!! This shops customer service was immaculate if I ever need anything else I know where to go THANK YOU THANK YOUUUUU
5112,Gorgeous & a perfect fit. Can't wait to show it off!
5113,Love! Thank you!
5114,I absolutely love these. Very flattering and seem very well made. Have only worn them poolside for one weekend.
5115,"Le produit est arrivé à temps , l'emballage intact. Le produit est de qualité. Je suis satisfaite."
5116,"Very vibrant in color! Arrived in good time, Lots of string for tying, bottoms fit nicely. I normally don't wear 2 pc. Suits but this one I love!! Maybe go a size bigger on top if you prefer more coverage but pieces slide on string to fit comfortably. :)"
5117,"D.Va!!!!!! Sooooo cute!!!! Fits absolutely perfectly!!! I am impressed because usually a ruched bottom gives me a plumber's crack, not these!! This fit was exactly what I was looking for, and the design is so fun!!!!!"
5118,"I got a small and it fits really well! It definitely exceeded my expectations, thank you so much!! :D"
5119,Very cute and well made. The fit is good and the D.Va logo looks like it should hold up through quite a bit of wear.
5120,"I really liked how the bikini looks. The bikini costs me about 100€ (the shiping to germany and customs). The material is very thin and doesn't feel that expensive (for what I paid OOF). The bottoms are very cute tho.  And the D.va print is pretty nice too. but I'm a bit disappointed :(
In general the bikini is okay, but for the price meh."
5121,"Very good communication and HIGH QUALITY, recommended. It’s a great bikini and the seller is nice."
5122,"Great quality, the colors are really vibrant. Fits perfectly."
5123,I like the bikini bottom a lot from the back it makes it look like you have a wedgie but that’s a good thing
5124,WELL MADE! I sew and am impressed with the quality. I wear a tennis skirt with this tank as my sun bathing suit. She followed all of my extra measurements exactly with just enough give. I love that it sits over my hips with out rolling up. As a grandma I feel confident being in the pool with my grandchildren and don’t mind if I’m caught in photo wearing this top :)
5125,"Savannah has great communication.  Back in the spring of 2017, I asked Savannah to make a custom maternity swim suit. I love it so much that I wore it not only the summer I was pregnant but the next summer too. The bathing suit top and bottoms are still in great condition after washing and drying several times. I have packed them up for my next pregnancy. Then this year, I asked her to make a custom swim shirt that would hide my belly fat. I told her how I wanted the shirt to look and she made it exactly as I envisioned! She also let me pick a different pattern that I absolutely love. It fits perfectly, it's super comfortable, it's pretty and the style does hide my belly fat. 😊.  The picture attached is the swim shirt that I ordered this year.  All I can say is that you will not be disappointed ordering from Savannah."
5126,I absolutely love this in tie-dye waves.  It is a very figure flattering top too.  Savannah did a great job as always!
5127,"Friends, I LOVE this etsy shop for modest swimwear. I got a maternity swimsuit last year and it was fantastic. I'd initially picked a fabric that wasn't going to work well for maternity so Savannah messaged me and helped me pick something better. This year, I just received a nursing swimsuit (it's got a nursing panel for easy access) and it is super cute! I'm excited to try it at the pool and the lake. The quality is exceptional and I appreciated customizing inseam length and sleeves. Savannah has amazing customer service and is great to work with. Shipping is fast and within her predicted timeline.  I would 100% buy from her again.
--Shem's wife"
5128,I got to choose my favorite fabric and the style of top that works best for me. It turned out great! :)
5129,Fits perfectly and so well made!  I'm happy with my 4th top from Savannah!
5130,Just as the swim skirt this one is perfect also. Savannah is such a sweet person and I appreciate her making modest swim wear. It's a true blessing. You will love her swim suits!
5131,"This is the best swimsuit I have ever owned! I love how it is made and how it fits and the workmanship is fabulous. I wore it to the lake and got so many compliments! The armholes are perfect- no gaping and the neckline is just right for chasing babies or swimming. Will definitely order one for maternity...and maybe nursing, too. Thanks Savannah!"
5132,Love my swim top! Great fabric! Love the look and fits perfect! Great seamstress!! :)
5133,"I love this top, made exactly to order!
Great Job Thanks Again"
5134,"Great modest top! Seller worked with me, and got the top just how I wanted it! Thank you so much!"
5135,This swim top is absolutely wonderful.  The workmanship is of the highest quality.  I love that I can have a beautiful swimsuit top and modesty too.  I will be ordering more!
5136,Savannah does amazing work! Fits great and is super comfortable!
5137,"This was going to be my suit. I never used it, just tried it on. The sleeve holes were too large and the tightness around the mid section squeezed me so bad it was terribly uncomfortable. It was also way too long, scrunched up too much in the mid-section to look even remotely attractive. I was very disappointed. The seller allowed me to return it (at my cost) stating it broke her own policy but she'd make an exception. She took 5% of the price I paid out of my refund. I have no comments to give about the fabric or it's quality, as I never used it."
5138,"Got this for a model for a Harley Quinn inspired photo shoot. Was concerned about fit but when she tried it on, she said it was perfect! She's happy and therefore I'm happy!"
5139,"So I kinda ordered this product last minute but I still got it on time, the seller was very nice and understanding!

The product itself is amazing, and the fit is very good and true to what it says when you order.

I got tons of compliments on my bikini for my event!"
5140,Fit perfect
5141,The bathing suit is great! It looks so good on and the material is a great quality. She even sewed in extra liners and pockets for my own inserts!
5142,I absolutely love it.  Amazing quality!! Would definitely order again! Thanks!!
5143,I LOVE it!! The suit fits me perfectly and I wore it when my husband and I went to Cancun!!! It is my favorite swimsuit ever!!
5144,"I love the Quality and the fact that the top fits perfectly, which istn't easy with big boobs to find. The only thing that's not perfect is the size of the bottom piece, which is a bit smal. I can wear it, but it's really at the edge of my comfort zone :D"
5145,"Fit is absolutely perfect! Super awesome piece, would definitely order from this shop again :)"
5146,"This fits perfectly and looks as pictured. Keep in mind, this is more of a fashion suit, so I wouldn't wear it if you're doing anything crazy as the top might slip.
I gave rather vague sizes as I'm somewhat in between sizes for things and it's hard to find things to fit properly right now and she managed to get it done anyway:)  She was so easy to work with and responded back quickly too."
5147,Love it!!  Lisa was great to work with and accommodating to the fit and style I needed.  And I received the swimsuit quickly.  Thanks :)
5148,It's perfect! It fits perfectly! The material is so comfortable! I couldn't be happier!
5149,This is exactly what i wanted! Fits perfect and is SUPER ADORABLE!!
5150,"I absolutely love my Harley Bikini.  The material is such a good quality and its very flattering.  I love the back of the bottoms and the ribbon ties, it all fits perfectly!

My Mr J can't wait to see it on me on holiday!"
5151,"I asked if this could be made in time for my vacation and she got it too me very quickly!  Love the bikini,  it looks great.  Fit perfectly"
5152,I love the design. The item shipped as expected from seller. Will definitely purchase again.
5153,Just got it! It fits perfect and it's gorgeous! It came really fast too!
5154,Fit perfectly! And no one else had anything like it!!!!!

5160,shipped faster than most things and better quality than others youd find at retail stores :) super happy  will have no problems ordering more
5161,I love it! Arrived earlier than expected and fits perfectly!
5162,My wife LOVES her new bikini.  She is so eager to be able to wear it to the beach that she is asking to go to Hawaii... rather than waiting until Summer. Thanks again!
5163,Super fast shipping! Amazing fit thanks so much!
5164,The item came in over the weekend and my wife absoluetly loves is hands down best purchase of the year
5165,Love it! Very nicely made
5166,extreamly satisfied best gift ever
5167,"Was a great gift for the girlfriend, she loves it and says it fits perfectly. Shipped pretty quick. Only downside was there's no padding between the 2 linings on the top so she had to put her own in to stop pokies. Still love it and will buy others from lisa"
5168,Looks awesome :) and got here really quickly
5169,"Exactement ce que j'attendais, confection et envoi rapide"
5170,It looked exactly like in the picture and fit perfectly!
5171,Exactly what I ordered and in a timely manner. Thank you very much for making this happen as a birthday gift in a short notice!
5172,"Got this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend and she loved it but only wishes it had some padding at the top. 

Maybe for future orders the seller could add that as an additional option."
5173,"the suit is awesome, the only thing that disappointed me, was no padding in the top and no opening for the option to insert  pad."
5174,Bought this for the Florabama Mullet Toss Beach Festival.  Perfect suit for this event.  Carefully took measurements as per the instructions and it fit great.   Tons of compliments and lots of people asking where I got it.
5175,"The shipping was surprisingly fast, the colors are even better in person, and did I mention how much I love this bikini? I will be buying more soon!"
5176,"Absolutely LOVED the bikini!  Great quality and came exactly as pictured as well as described! 

Above and beyond the product was the incredible customer service! The bathing suit was shipped in a lightning fast manner and the communication with the seller was nothing short of prompt, accommodating and professional. 

I would highly recommend this line as well as the service from the seller to any girl that wants to look incredible and have an easy time doing so in such a hot and sexy suit!

Thank you HunniBunni for such respectable customer service and an awesome bikini to take to Texas for the 4th of July! I'll be doing business with you again in the near future!!!"
5177,Super cute. Lined and really good quality. I got the M/L in both the top and bottom and say that the bottoms are more towards medium and the top is more towards large. Fits perfect!
5178,"This is even cuter  than it is in the photos! The material is good quality! The colors are bright and vibrant! And best of all the owner, the  FLAWLESS CUSTOMER SERVICE! 
I have no-ass-at-all disease (lol) so reg size sm bikini bottoms are too big for me 90% of the time no matter where I buy them. When I had written Hunni Bunni letting them know that I had received the suit and that as usual;  the bottoms were too big for me and I told them that I give up on trying to find a company that makes them like the girl I have always bought them from at $120 per suit!!  I sent them a photo of one of my suits and within 2 days they had custom made me a bottom and shipped it to me for free ! And you know what? THEY FIT LIKE A GLOVE! Thank you everyone at Hunni Bunni for being so good to me!"
5179,Absolutely beautiful. Fits great. I am 5'4 130lbs and fairly fit. I went with a small and it fits perfect. It's very sexy and definitely stands out. Love it!!!
5180,LOVE THE SUITE!  Perfect fit
5181,"My Wife Absolutely Loves Her New Camouflage Pink Bikini

5182,Just like the picture!  Vibrant color! Fits well. Very fast shipping . Love it! Buying another one today :)
5183,The swimsuit is super cute in person and looks just like the picture. The sizing was the only thing that made it a little difficult...typically I wear a medium and these suits came in a M/L...I think they're more on the medium side.
5184,Its super cute... thanks so much
5185,Everyone loves these bikinis! =)
5186,"I love this bikini!!! One of my favorites. The fit is perfect, I don't have a body like the model, im 5'5 with an athletic build and it still looks amazing!! Shipped so quick & I'm going to buy another one soon."
5187,"Shipped quickly, fits perfect. Love this adorable bikini."

5193,"I ordered s/m bottoms to my bikini which were very tiny. I sent it back in to exchange for a m/l, after reviewing the tracking from the post office, there was a delay in the package and after emailing hunnibunni, I got quick and accurate responses! I've already received my m/l and they fit perfect!"
5194,LOVE LOVE LOOOOOOVE IT!
5195,I love how it fits

5217,Super cute but not really a fan of bikini tops that aren't padded.
5218,Shipped quickly. Little small on top but not much

5224,"New favorite swimsuit. It's beautiful and well-made. Shipped super fast too! The listing for the bottoms as well as customer reviews said to order one size up for the bottoms and I did, and they fit perfect. Top fit true to size just as the listing says:)"

5237,i love it! The top is super pretty and good quality for a good price :)
5238,Exactly as described. Bought as a gift and fit Perfectly!!! Awesome bathing suit!!! Let me know when u have more styles 👍😘

5240,"Cut and Design are exactly like the photo. The Colors are more vibrant on the actual suit. 

A great purchase!!!!"
5241,Love the top it fits perfectly! The bottoms were insanely small tho even in a large
5242,Beautiful!
5243,Beautiful design and colors. Looks better in person. Its purple with blue designs which i love. On the computer it looks like dark blue with light blue designs.
5244,So beautiful!!! Top was a little too small.
5245,Beautiful! I wear 32DD and this top is a perfect fit
5246,Love it!  I appreciate it.

5253,Beautiful bottom but runs a little small. Wear 27 or 3 and reordered a medium.
5254,"Absolutely beautiful swimsuit. Make note that the bottoms do not stretch at all, so you may need a size bigger than you think."
5255,Love the swimsuit bottom...perfect fit! Thank you!
5256,XL bottoms run smalllllllllll for a booty
5257,Such a pretty bathing suit design! The baiting suit is really good quality for the price. Size up for bottoms like they say (:
5258,Now I have the matching set! Thank you!!
5259,"quality made.  does run small, but ordering a size larger worked great."
5260,Thank you the bikini is sweet!
5261,Awesome thank you so much!
5262,Great quality I will be returning!
5263,Very cute. Good quality for price. Wish the small top was available but sold out. Not sellers fault. Would order other items from this seller.
5264,The bottoms are very small
5265,"I contacted the company to ask about sizing. They never bothered to respond to my email specifically asking about size. Once i received the swimsuit bottom, the size was very small resembling a small size not anywhere near a large.  When i emailed to asked all they say is sorry you should have ordered up. Well thanks a lot for never responding to my email until i actually made a purchase and then telling me sorry your loss.  Definitely very unprofessional and a little rude about it too.  Not even a ""im so sorry"" just its your fault.  I wont be a return customer.
the store than suggested i disassemble the swimsuit and break the metal clasps to make it fit better......smh"
5266,Love my bathing suite! I wore it for the first time and everyone was coming up to me asking where I got it. It’s very flattering on me as well. Thank you for making. Suite custom to my built.
5267,"Fantastic company  to work  with.Great communication, delivery ,and product.I LOVE my bathing suit! Top notch quality. Will buy again in the future."
5268,Gorgeous SS!!!   In LOVE!!!  Thank you!
5269,Such amazing quality... The fit is perfect... She was very helpful in deciding what size/measurement to order.... ❤️❤️❤️❤️
5270,"I ordered this suit for a trip to Mexico..... I am a very picky person about how things look. When I received this in the mail, I fell in love with it.  The quality of the material and how it is put together is amazing. I just ordered a second monokini for the trip. She has helped with the process in order to help me make a suit that will fit my personality. I would and have recommended the suits to several people now. I don't see myself buying from anyone else or from a store again."
5271,"Love the suit, thank you."
5272,Awesome! Thank you so much for all of your help. Gorgeous Suit!
5273,Amazing customer service!! High end product !!
5274,Arrived on schedule. Gorgeous swimsuit. Thank you.
5275,These swim trunks are more than we expected... material is exceptional & size is on point... will definitely order another pair you can’t go wrong with these trunks and long to the knee is an extra plus for my man
5276,Bought as a birthday present and we're both so happy with them. The detail looks even better in person.
5277,"My boyfriend likes it alot, perfect size. It looks great. Thank you"
5278,"The swim shorts are great quality.  Print is awesome, my husband is happy.  Shop owner addresses questions/concerns with no issues.  Will definitely be ordering again from this shop."
5279,Exactly what I was looking for. Since I just had a baby I feel a little insecure about my post baby body but this swimsuit makes me feel so confident & so beautiful! I seriously love it & definitely will be ordering from this shop again! ❤
5280,"This swimsuit turned out adorable.  I just wish the bottom of the bows were sewn down also, they float up in the water. I had to sew down myself. I was nervous about the stripes but it was great. Fabric is quality also."
5281,"I ordered two suits and plan on ordering more!! I’m always active at the beach and in and out of the water. These suits totally stand up to ocean waves!! They really are seamless, no lumps or bumps!!!"
5282,LOVE!!
5283,Love!!!! Super cute! Awesome fit and love this material! Soooo soft!
5284,I love this bikini! It made me look amazing and the quality is outstanding!
5285,Looks just like the picture and fits like it should. I get compliments every time that I wear it. I love it!
5286,"Perfect fit on the bottom, the top is a little small on me personally, but it's the largest they have and I have a larger chest."
5287,The size on the bottom was bigger then I expected am a size 6 in it fit a bit loose. But the suit is very cute and we'll made...can't wait to wear it!
5288,Love these! They are very cheeky but super cute.
5289,"Super fast shipping, and probably the cutest bikini ever! Super happy with this!"
5290,So soft and fits perfect! Shows off the cheeks just enough and goes great with any top!
5291,Great quality. Bottoms were very true to size
5292,"Exactly as described. Perfect!
Excellent quality and sizing correct"
5293,Wonderful quality swim suit.  Can't wait to wear it.
5294,"I like it, though cheaper material than assumed."
5295,It looks wonderful but unfortunately I never got it due to complications. But the situation was handled very well.
5296,"These bottoms are okay, a good design and well made. I had ordered another bottom from here, which I was later told was no longer in stock, the other I picked this one in was no longer in stock. They took a really long time to respond and ship which was stressful as I was going out of town. They did refund for the missing item."
5297,"Ordered and they messaged me after saying they don't have the color. They gladly gave me a refund, but why have it available as a choice if it's not available ?"
5298,"Ugh, I can't justifiably express how in love I am with my new kini💗🦋 made with complete aloha straight from the aina, you can feel it in the fabric🌈 my sister also loves her seamless bottoms SO much, we have been obsessing over our kinis ever since we received them. They were exactly what I imagined and beyond!! Mahalo siSTAR!!"
5299,These bottoms fit me better than I expected and I am so getting more colors. I wear a size 6 in jeans and I got a large.
5300,"Absolutely love it! Totally worth the wait! It's thongy-cheeky and it's really secure! I got a small and it's not super tight to where it'll squeeze my love handles, so it's a good fit! Overall, I'm thinking about getting another color!"
5301,"This bottom fits so perfect and it’s sits just right on my waist which is a first for me! Most bottoms sit too low and with how thin I am the waistband doesn’t hug my hips right. But with this bikini bottom it fits perfect and the fabric is very high quality on top of that. Not to mention, it looks great and is probably the best thong bottom I’ve ever gotten. My only recommendation is if you are a wider set girl to get a size up because the small just barely fits me and I’m very skinny. Other than that I will definitely be purchasing from this lovely store again."
5302,in love with these. really high quality and fits so cute. i will be frequenting this shop after we move to oahu. :)
5303,"Extremely well made, very comfortable, & fits amazing! Thank you! Only downfall is since they're made to order it took 3 weeks to receive; well worth the wait but just a warning if anyone has crunch time before holiday :)"
5304,SO PERFECT literally just what I was looking for! Perfect fit and also great material!! Definitely buying more
5305,I've been searching for thong bikini bottoms for so long and am really happy I finally found the perfect ones! They're really comfy and super flattering. I love them!
5306,"So well-made and so attractive! I had to make an exchange in sizing and it was easy, seller was very responsive. Thank you!"
5307,"Looks amazing! The size chart is perfectly accurate, but if you’re worried about being between sizes, the band is very stretchy so you can go for the smaller of the two. Took a little longer to ship than first expected, but it was right over Christmas that I ordered it so it made sense and the seller was quick to respond when I asked for an update. Thank you! ❤️"
5308,Absolutely perfect!! I ordered 2 suits and both are so flattering and beautifully made. Couldn’t be happier - Iniki will definitely be my go-to for bikinis forever ❤️
5309,Had a problem with my first order but Annie was so nice and offered to remake them for me and I’m sure they will be just as cute and comfortable as the first pair. Such amazing customer service thank you so much!
5310,"So well-made and so attractive! I had to make an exchange in sizing and it was easy, seller was very responsive. Thank you! Will buy from again :)"
5311,"My wife was´t sure about wearing a thong bikini at first, but she LOVED it! She wore it on our honeymoon, and I must say she looked so sexy in this!
Also, great service and fast delivery :)"
5312,I love these bottoms! They are super cute and super comfortable!
5313,Love these bottoms! & such a good price with the sale! Can't wait until the next sale so I can buy a few more in different colors!!
5314,Love them ended up buying another pair and will continue to as more patterns come out! 💜
5315,They totally fit and so Cute!!!!!
5316,"Perfect sizing. Amazing seller. Thank you for making a quality product that fits, and looks great!"
5317,Fits perfectly. Definitely ordering another pair soon!
5318,"Bottoms are super cute, fit is great. Exactly what I was looking for!"
5319,Love this bottom! Cute and cheeky!
5320,"This swimsuit makes me look like an Amazonian warrior goddess. I have never felt so good about a bathing suit in my life. I am 5'2"", 100lbs, and size 0 pant; ordered the size XS and it is perfection. Could not be happier or more confident going into this swim season!"
5321,"Absolutely gorgeus, need more! Came quickly thank you!!"
5322,Great quality and feel! Thank you!
5323,I love this top so much oh my lord! Corinne was kind enough as to make a custom size for me and leave me a note in my package. Her work is absolutely perfect and well worth the money. I will definitely be recommending her designs to my friends.
5324,"You go girl! - handmade consistency is hard to achieve, but these suits are amazing; crafted with care and consistently beautiful. I probably could have ordered a slightly larger size, but you never really know until you know. I'm keeping it. Hope to order again sometime too :)"
5325,"This is a very pretty top. I received it quickly and it is as shown. It's smaller than I thought it would be, but it is exactly as she described it, so I should have measured. I'm going to keep it, because the next size would probably look too big. I'm fairly flat chested. I wish the triangles slid along the strap, making it more adjustable. Very pretty work. Thank you."
5326,"So so obsessed with my Leo bikini! Wish I could post a picture! She handmade it into the style I wanted and made sure it arrived before I left for my vacation! I am not kidding when I say over 300 people complemented me at the music festival, coolest bathing suit I've ever owned. Thanks again!!!"
5327,"I love this bikini! The fit is super cute and made just for me. I've also worn the top as a crop top with shorts and gotten loads of compliments. Great customer service, great product!"
5328,Arrived super fast and fits perfectly.
5329,Amazing product and fits well!
5330,"Okay, so I want to start by saying that I received this package maybe two hours ago, and tried it on maybe a half hour after receiving it, at the most. And...well, I haven't taken it off since. I am in love with this swim suit. I can't even believe how beautiful it is! I keep thinking if I take it off maybe it'll disappear because I just can't believe it fits so well and it's so incredibly comfortable and perfect in every way! It is, without a doubt, the best swim wear purchase I have ever purchased-ever! Probably even the best swim/beach/summer item I own! This thing is amazing, the craftsmanship and the look and just everything-everything is perfect! And don't even get me started on the kindness of the owner! They are amazing! I can happily say that-I'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite bikini in the Galaxy."
5331,"Love, love, looooove my new bikini! It fits great and I adore the wider straps for my behemoth boobies. I like the bottoms too that are adjustable so I can wear them how I like! ""I'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite bikini on the Citadel!"""
5332,"This is my favourite bikini on the citadel!

Beautiful bikini, shipped fast, and easily the highest quality swimsuit I've ever owned. So happy with it!"
5333,In love with this swim suit. Thank you so much.
5334,"Amazing!!! Not only a brilliant product that fits perfectly, but the seller also was kind enough to meet a shipping deadline for me so I could wear it at a convention. Highly recommended!"
5335,Fits perfectly!! Thank you so much!! I love it!!
5336,I like how I was asked to put in both my pants size and my bra size to ensure I got a good fit both on the top and the bottom...and it fits me great!!
5337,"Covid made me take a long time to post the review, but the suit and service are FABULOUS!!!  When fit wasn't quite right, seller had me send back and she taylored it perfectly to me.  Thanks so much!"
5338,The colours are gorgeous and it fits perfectly! Excited for when the pool opens!!
5339,The bathing suit feels high quality. I'm very excited to test this swimsuit at the beach  this summer!
5340,This swimsuit is wonderful!  It's super cute and fits me like a glove.  I'm ready to take on the Presidium pool.
5341,"A little less fabric on the bottom then comfortable, but fits well. Top bunches in places, but it's really well made. Would buy again maybe with those specifications. Seller was kind and responsive. Overall; really well made."
5342,Well made. Great fit. Just required the inserts in the bra to hide her nipples and my girlfriend was very happy
5343,Suit arrived quickly and safely - looks exactly as pictured! Good quality and fits perfectly!
5344,"Quick shipping, fits perfectly, super comfy and looks amazing!"
5345,High quality material and craftsmanship. My wife loves it!
5346,"Great fit, and it looks just like the photos"
5347,"Exactement ce que j'attendais, confection et envoi rapide"
5348,Item is well made and came on time. Girlfriend loved it
5349,"This bikini is gorgeous. I got complemented before I even left the house. The design is intricate, but it feels very sturdy. I can definitely see myself using the top as a crop top too. Perfect for a tropical getaway or anywhere you'd want to stand out from the crowd in a boho way."
5350,Ah soooo in love with the top! Super cute fit! She even let me mix and match my colors so I have a really cute black top with blue bottom combo! Great communication and fast shipping! Thank you!
5351,This bikini is everything I hoped for! It's super soft- and the owner of the shop was very responsible in packaging and communication. I got it all the way in Texas in 5 days from ordering. I actually just ordered another one because I was so satisfied! Thank you Pomcloset!!
5352,"Very fast shipping!  The tracking info was provided, though I generally find that it's not reliable with international shipping.  I ordered this top in black and brown, and they are super sexy!  The shopper was very kind and communicative from start to finish, and I would absolutely buy from this shop again.  P.S.  Thank you to the seller for the cute European postcard--that was extremely nice of you!"
5353,"as described, but should have ordered a smaller size..the bottoms were a little big."
5354,GREAT fit and adorable. Only drawback is that when the crochet gets wet it soaks up the water so the bottoms can get heavy and sag.
5355,Trägt sich sehr schön auf der Haut :-)
5356,Love it!!!can't wait to wear to the beach next month!!!!!
5357,Awesome service and quality!
5358,Pleasure to shop with.  Went our of their way to exchange part which was too small.. Highly recommend this seller.
5359,"Absolutely amazing customer service, she worked with me when the structure didn’t work for me and now I have an amazing swimsuit that makes me feel comfortable and cute"
5360,I'm extremely happy with the purchase I have made! My swimsuit fits perfectly! The shop owner takes great care of you if you're not satisfied with a purchase. Very easy to communicate with. The shipping was free. What more can you ask for?
5361,Loved it! Just as pic and as described.
5362,"This is my 4th piece from this shop and I continue to be obsessed and in love with how flattering this swimwear is! This top was made beautifully and the seller used my measurements and special requests to make it the perfect fit. If I could rate this shop higher than 5 stars I would! Looking forward to ordering more, as I have never loved swimsuit shopping until now!"
5363,"I like the concept ! But for some reason my tops extra string that like rims the cups fabric , wasn't attached. No big deal, it can be worn with out it. But it doesn't fit me. I do have a cup size of 34G ... haha so not much fits me anyways to my liking. Love how it looks though if I wanna be more revealing ❤️"
5364,Oh mahhhh gawddddd I loveeeeeee thissss!!!! Thank you AGAIN for the swimsuit! It fits perfectly! So happy! As always! Super fast shipping!
5365,Love these bikini tops. So comfy. Cute designs too. Soft thicker ties so they don’t cut into you. Great colors. This is my 3rd one. ❤️
5366,"Love this top! I would like to purchase more in different colors! Great fit, good quality, and looks just like pictured! Thank you for the great experience and expedited shipping! Much appreciated!"
5367,Cutest bikini top ever. Super comfy and fits perfectly.
5368,Love the style of this very sexy top! Fits perfectly!  need one in every color!
5369,This top is perfect
5370,"This is my new favorite swimsuit and top, in general! Great support and perfect style."
5371,Needed help on sizing and seller was great
5372,The color is exactly as pictured
5373,"These are exactly what I was looking for! Seller helped me figure out size, I'm 128lb 5'7, I sent her my measurements since I was worried a small wouldn't fit, she suggested a medium and it's just right. The perfect amount of coverage!"
5374,So nicely made and fits perfect! The color is vibrant and really matches my bikini top. Thanks!
5375,This swimsuit is absolutely amazing!!!! The fabric is soft and it supports my C cup chest perfectly as long as I tie the neck nice and tight. I love having the open back but it still comes up high enough in front to cover my stretch marks. Perfect for a postpartum mom that still wants to look and feel sexy! The only downside was that the bottom was a little too wide for my hips and waist (although my measurements fit in the size chart) so I just took them in a little since I sew. Otherwise this swimsuit is just gorgeous and I can't wait to wear it all summer!
5376,"I just received my swimsuit today and I am in love!! Ms. Kerry did a custom swimsuit design for me and it is beautiful! She was the sweetest to work with, and I will definitely re-purchase again! Thank you SO much! :)"
5377,Love love love this bathing suit! The suit is made very well and fits perfectly! I highly recommend buying this product!
5378,"Really nice! It tends to move around a bit so it's not perfect for swimmers, but it's very flattering (:"
5379,"Fits really well, it's a little more revealing than I am used to but it looks and feels better than any other style I've tried."
5380,The fit is great and I enjoyed it all summer
5381,Very cute great seller thank you
5382,"Pardon my messy mirror and room, but i am ECSTATIC about this bikini!!! The quality is unmatched for the amazing price. It’s rare you find bikinis that are this well made for under $100.00 a piece. I was truly beside myself when i tried this on. So so so happy. The seller is amazing, too. Quick responses and it was literally shipped to me in like two days. SO HAPPY!!!!"
5383,"I was worried my fast shipping wouldn’t make it to me before my trip, but they did!! I appreciate the fast turn around from Florida to California. I love these bottoms!! I’m not a thong girl and went for it on a trip with my boyfriend. He loved them!"
5384,"Love love love these bottoms, I’m 5’4 140lbs and muscular build. These are M and they fit like a glove! Thank you!"
5385,In love with this bikini! It fit perfectly and hides my hip dips  without cutting into my sides which I didn't expect. Will definitely purchase more.
5386,Yes love it!!  UNBELIEVABLE quick ship!  Thank you!’
5387,"High quality material. I'm 5'5, 130lb, athletic build- I ordered a S."
5388,My favorite swimsuit hands down!!!!!!
5389,Beautiful bikini bottoms! Fit perfectly!
5390,Love this bottom. It’s true to size. The owner is incredibly helpful with questions.
5391,My first order was the wrong size but the seller quickly fixed it with an exchange. Love the pieces.
5392,I loved it. It fits great.
5393,i love it look great on emily
5394,"Great experience and a high-quality product! I ordered a top and a bottom as a gift for my partner, and they seem to run a little small."
5395,So comfortable. So sexy! I can't wait for the quarantine to be over so I can show it off at the beach!
5396,"Beautiful bright colors, runs a little bit bigger but it's lovely"
5397,Thanks I love it.  Will be great when I go on a girls trip next year.
5398,"This cover up is absolutely amazing. Not only is it beyond perfect it arrived nearly a week early to :) 
I'm so happy. I will definitely be buying more"
5399,I was leaving that week for a vacation when I discovered this coverup!!! and Sarah made it for me that same day and sent it out and I received it in 2 days. So nice of her !!!
5400,Fabulous caftan. Received several compliments at the pool while on holiday and directed one of them to this store so they could buy their own.
5401,"I haven’t worn it yet, but this is exactly what I was looking for as a cover-up.  Can’t wait to wear it! So classy."
5402,Can always count on this designer to deliver a quality product. Love the fabric !
5403,It was well made but fit differently than expected
5404,"it comes up high on the sides, and doesn't offer a lot of breast support. BUT it's hella cute, and i get a lot of compliments on it."
5405,Awesome swimsuit! The cut is flattering and I think it’s definitely true to size. I’m already looking forward to wearing it while consuming questionable amounts of champagne this summer. Shipping was also quick 😊 Highly recommend!
5406,"Very disappointed in the suit. I wanted to love it--cute idea, but very low quality. Main complaint is letter spacing (kerning) is completely off making each word look like two separate words ""Champ  agne Camp aign"" . Also, size of suit runs extremely short in the torso for a very short or small breasted woman. Quality of suit is poor, more like a one time wear Halloween costume fabric, rather than a swimsuit that would even last a season. Sadly, I will not wear this suit but it isn't returnable according to the company info."
5407,"Such an amazingly cute beach dress I love it.
It fits perfectly and looks wonderful"
5408,"The dress/top is just gorgeous, the seller communicative and the delivery spot on. I am a UK size 16, and this fits perfectly, it will also fit smaller ladies equally as well."
5409,"This dress/shirt is beautiful, shipment was on time and Hemio was very communicative. I highly recommend this seller."
5410,Very well made. Love it!
5411,Exactly what I wanted! Thank you.
5412,"Look different than the picture, it's shorter and wider ...I'll still wear though"
5413,A fast and flawless transaction.
5414,"PERFECTION! 
GREAT COMMUNICATION!
CUTE PACKAGING!"
5415,Awesome fit and colour! Very happy with this purchase.
5416,"The swimsuit is absolutely amazing. It fits me exactly how I had hoped! Also, Anthony is wonderful to work with. I accidentally received the wrong bottoms with my order and when I contacted him about it, he was quick to respond. Within two days he had made and shipped the correct bottoms! Definitely would buy from this shop again :)"
5417,I like it a lot! Thanks! :)
5418,"I love it absolutely!!!! so far my best experience on etsy. It shipped faster that i expected. Perfect pants, i could not imagine this product to be better! We already tried those pants at our swim meet- everybody wants them now! they came wrapped so cute! My best etsy shopping! Thank you!"
5419,"Anna is simply the best!!  Super fast shipping, awesome customer service and GREAT QUALITY product.  Definitely made with love ❤️. My son absolutely loves his towel pants!!  Thank you Anna!"
5420,My son received a custom made pair of towel pants for Christmas and LOVES them.  He is excited to wear them to and from swim practice and to meets.  Thank you for an incredibly awesome product!
5421,I can't wait for my daughter to open these on Christmas morning. They turned out great and the seller's communication was outstanding throughout the purchasing process.
5422,Very well made and fit perfectly. My son loves them!! Quick delivery as well. Thank you!
5423,The pants are great I have ordered custom colors and the quality is amazing. Great for swim especially in a cold weather.
5424,"The pants are just perfect. My swimmer loves them, great quality, wash well and the costumer service was excellent."
5425,My son loves his towel pants and Anna was wonderful and easy to work with!
5426,Great communication from the seller! Just as described. Thank you!
5427,OMG absolutely amazing swimsuit. The material is a dream and hugs every curve! Ahhhhh I’m so in love. Thank you 🤟🤗🥰
5428,"LOVE this suit!! The fit is so comfortable and amazing. It’s super unique to most suits you’ve seen and the quality is outstanding. I haven’t worn it yet, so can’t speak to how it holds up, but from what I can see so far I imagine rocking this for years to come! Definitely read the description though, it is exactly as described, not lined and no bra support. Works great for me but maybe not for everyone. My only negative is the color is much more brown than it showed in the photo. I thought I was getting something with a hint of purple/burgundy to it, but it is very brown. The color is called “shabby brown” though, so can’t complain too much there, and still adore it!"
5429,Looks and feels like a million bucks!
5430,"Just got this in the mail and I'm super excited! The other reviews are correct to say that it feels like second skin. The quality of the material is incredible and very soft, there aren't any seams or elastic parts like store bought swimsuits which cause unflattering pinching here and there. The style and fit is sexy and cool on top of the most comfortable swimsuit I've ever owned. I'm 153cm tall and my ass has never looked so go in a swimsuit. I will be purchasing again in the future and have already spread the word. Truly unique, just buy it! 

A small thing to note which to me is not a problem at all, but in the crotch area there isn't one of those small pieces of fabric normally sewn on there. I think that would actually ruin the seamless style and fit of the swimsuit."
5431,Stunning on. Hugs every curve. Fabric and workmanship top notch.
5432,"Merci beaucoup, une très belle matière."
5433,Love it!!beautiful!!!Rose is even more amazing than the bikinis she makes;)thank you so much rose for your hard work and getting to me so quickly!
5434,"Rose,
My daughter loves her touched bottoms ! Thanks again! Suzanne"
5435,"Perfect fit, beautiful colors! I ordered another suit"
5436,This arrived quickly and just in time for my vacation!  Perfect fit and looked super cute!
5437,Fit great! Super cute! And fast delivery! ❤️
5438,Fit is perfect and seller was super helpful! I'll be ordering again!
5439,Perfect! Lovely quality and they look great on. Thank you :)
5440,Just what I was looking for! Arrived promptly!
5441,The color and design are great and I love the fabric and braided straps. I needed to size up to a medium. For reference I’m a 32 A/B with an athletic build. The seller was great and made the return process easy. Now I’m just waiting for the medium to arrive so I can show it off this summer!
5442,Absolutely love it! Even came earlier than expected! Size Chart is very accurate!
5443,"Love, love, love!! This fabric and braided straps are sexy and unique for summer. I’m a 32 A/B with an athletic build and sized up to a medium. The shop owner is great and helpful!"
5444,Fits great. Love the material!
5445,Bikini fabric is alright.  Braids are scratchy and not comfortable.  When lifting my arms my under boob comes out considerably.  I bought a M and I’m a 34B. I also was under the impression that I was receiving the bottoms and the top but I guess that was my fault for not reading the fine print.  All in all I’m disappointed I paid 24$ for a bikini top that I can’t wear. I only wish I could exchange It but because of their policy they won’t allow.
5446,"Love it fits perfectly. I got a size S and I am 5'8"" 125 lbs."
5447,"amazing!!! we got six of them and we are all obsessed!!! the quality and fit is amazing, the colours are so vibrant, and the material is awesome!!! Not to mention it came in literally a week!? Such outstanding customer service too, we received so mich help with every inquiry we had!! Would 12/10 purchase again!!"
5448,Fast shipping and looks exactly like the picture! Ordered for a Halloween costume which will work perfectly and I also plan on wearing it again as a bathing suit too
5449,This was perfect for my 80's workout barbie halloween costume - and came SO quick - thank you so much!
5450,"This is really cute and I loved wearing it for halloween. It would make a cute bathing suit too! Shipped very fast, thank you! I'm 5'2, size 8, M, 32DD. I ordered a large and it was perfect"
5451,I used it for my Halloween wand It was adorable and fit so well!!
5452,"Very very fast shipping and great quality! A bit small/short for a taller person, im 125 lbs and 5'7"" and its just a tad short for my body, but ill make it work. love it!"
5453,"AMAZING! Good quality, fast shipping AND she was an efficient and fabulous communicator! I ordered 12 and they came within a week! 
Highly recommend ❤️"
5454,"I love this product! Awesome quality and shipped in no time. Only complaint is the sizing. It does run a little large so I would size down. I am usually between xs/s, went with the s and wish I would’ve went with xs. Still fits, but is a little loose especially in the bust. My measurements are: 5’4.5, 128 lbs, 32 bust, 25 waist, 34 hips. Hope this helps!"
5455,"Love my item so much, great quality and so cute! Also I was beyond impressed with SunnyshopbyOlesea! Fast response time, awesome communication, very personalized and wonderful experience purchasing!"
5456,Loved Barbie suit for my halloween costume! Will wear again as a normal swimsuit..and the shipping was super fast!
5457,"I’m 5’2”, 145lbs, a 36C and the medium fit perfectly! Not too tight,not too loose & feels comfy."
5458,Absolutely love it! I bought this for a Halloween costume and it fit true to size. I typically order a large and was pleased that it fit! Personally wished it had some padding in it but other than that it was perfect!
5459,This came so fast and was perfect for my Halloween costume. It fit exactly how I wanted as well! Thank you!
5460,Exactly as described and worked perfect for my costume!
5461,A bit see through — overall true to size! Made a wonderful piece to a Halloween costume. Would buy here again!
5462,Fit perfectly!! I loved it!!
5463,"The suit came quickly and it is perfect!! Thank you so much, I would definitely recommend. The pink is a beautiful color and will work perfectly for my halloween costume."
5464,loved it perfect for halloween
5465,Great item! Fits amazing and looks super cute. I wish it did come in cuter packaging though because it is an adorable suit but everything else was perfect.
5466,"I'm 5' 11"" I weigh 185lbs (ordered XL). The suit fits well, I think the crotch is too wide. Beyond that it is perfect, the lettering is gorgeous !!!! It is high quality."
5467,I’ve gotten nothing but compliments on this. It’s a super fun suit. No shrinkage or tears after multiple washes and wears.

5479,Fit well! Super cute for my Halloween costume just wish it wasn’t such thin material.
5480,"Loved the bright pink color. Fit wasn’t what I expected. Was a little too low for my chest than I would’ve liked, and you definitely need some padding because the material will show every bump. Wore this with a bra for my Photoshoot & did the job."
5481,Fit great. Fast Shipping. Just as pictured
5482,I absolutely love this! Fit perfectly and shipped very quickly! Thank you so much

5523,Always great service this is my second purchase and I love my swimwear❤️.
5524,This is perfect. I have been looking for something like this for ages and am so happy I found you.
5525,Love these! So comfortable and amazing quality! Only tops I wear now!
5526,"I love the way the fit! I’m particular with my bathing suits and the sizes are always perfect! 
Thank you!! 😍"
5527,"I can not say enough how amazing these bathing suits fit. I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find tops that fit my bust. I am always disappointed, until now. I have the support and coverage I need while it still being a pleasing design. The shipping was super quick. She was very accommodating. I plan to buy tops in many more colors."
5528,Love them all perfect fit and super comfy!!!
5529,"Fits perfectly, high quality material and color is beautiful. Speedy shipping got it here earlier than expected!"
5530,Very fast and super generous love all the suits!
5531,Love it ! The shop does excellent work. I am a repeat buyer and plan to continue shopping here.
5532,Great Product and Great Service
5533,"Pretty disappointed in this bikini. The stitching is poorly done, the bottom is NOT highwaisted as described, and the white bikini IS see through when wet, although the description says it is not."
5534,"Absolutely love Lucy!  she is so amazing at whats she does! Lucy always response in a timely manner and if she can’t do something always has a second option for you. I been buying from Lucy for 6 years now and never once was disappointed. Keep up the good work, great quality as well! 💕 (side note great for women who have huge boobies like me that can’t seem to find a target swimsuit that fits the top right!) 😊"
5535,"I am so excited that I have finally found a bathing suit I LOVE!! I just received my first one in the mail and I am about to order one in another color! I struggle with finding bathing suits that are young and sexy, but also give enough coverage and flattering for my body type. The bottoms are a little cheeky and high cut which is very flattering on. The top provides enough coverage and support for a 34DD cup. It's also very comfortable since the halter strap is double banded and adjustable. I highly recommend sending in your unique measurements as Lucy does an amazing job to replicate that. 

Also, I had a question about my shipment and Lucy was so quick to respond and empathetic to my situation. She checked into the issue for me and was very communicative through out the process."
5536,Love every one of my bikinis I've ordered! They always ship super fast and fit perfectly. I always get compliments on them too :)
5537,Amazing fit!!!!!!!A+++
5538,really cute and great quality! made to fit me perfectly. love it!
5539,My fiancé is freaking out over this. She wants me to order a 2nd right now. Its the first swimsuit that she feels works with her body type.
5540,"Absolutely love the top, wish the bottoms didn't pinch as much on the sides but overall great bikini!"
5541,Once again Lucy did amazing job! Thank you!
5542,Love this bikini so much!
5543,I love the color!! Fit me great
5544,love it! if your wrap around  string is short on you ask the shop for a longer one.
5545,I love it but there were a few strings hanging that could get snagged
5546,I just went swimming for the day at a nearby lake and this top stayed on perfectly!  I wear D bra and got a medium and it is a bit tight but that's what I wanted. Great product and CUTE!
5547,"Love it, although M was to small for me. Ordered a bigger size and new all happy. Thks so much !"
5548,"My 3rd Margo top-- absolutely fabulous, comfortable and stays in place!"
5549,Just love it ... so smooth to wear !
5550,I LOVE this bathing suit. I barely buy clothing online because I am usually skeptical on how it will look in person. This suit is perfect. The colors are bright and the quality in great. Thank you so much! Can't wait to get to the beach :)
5551,Beautiful! I’m so in love with this bikini!! Great quality and so eye-catching. I highly recommend 🙌🏻😍
5552,"Great fit,,,,"
5553,amazing swim suit!! Love it and it fits perfect
5554,"It looks amazing,and can’t wait to see the look on my girlfriend’s face when she gets it!!Thank you very much!!!"
5555,"This is my second order from her.  I asked for custom changes to the first item in order to get a better fit.  I couldn't be happier with every aspect of the transaction.  The item looked great, and was shipped on time.  Well worth the money and I expect to order again in the future.  GREAT JOB!!!!"
5556,"I was slightly disappointed that the item did not have the white border as pictured.  But every other aspect of the transaction was great, including working with me to ensure the item shipped in time to be there when I needed it."
5557,I'm really happy with the product.  Well done!
5558,It was very cool and sexy
5559,"All I can say is WOW! I'm amazed by the amount of care from the beginning of the purchase to the end. I contacted the owner to get more information about size and fit, and to my surprise she was able to create a custom order. I had shown her a picture of a swimsuit I had purchased online from a seperate swimwear company,the bikini I had purchased wasn't made to wear in water. PriyaSwimwear was able to create a replica of the swimsuit I loved, and the biggest wow factor was when I had recieved the swimsuit in the mail, there were two packages. She had included another swimsuit set which I wasn't expecting at all. All I can say it thankyou so so much for all the hard work you put into my order, and I can't wait to purchase from you again!

Thankyou!!"
5560,"This suit is super flattering. The bottom hugs perfectly, staying on well without pinching or causing any bulging. The top enhances the bust beautifully. I love it and have had lots of compliments! I was weary of buying a suit without trying it on first, and when I sent a message to the maker regarding size, she was really helpful and recommended a perfect fit."
5561,Greatttttt customer service excellent quality awesome swim suit
5562,Very cute bikini and store was easy to work with.
5563,"Excellent packaging, quick and awesome shipping, super sexy! Included some cute scented stuff I just put in my bathroom :D"
5564,"..ein neues Lieblingsstück. Netter Kontakt - Lieferung ein wenig verzögert, lag jedoch nicht am Lieferanten"
5565,"A super hot swim top, even a little more spicy in person ;)"
5566,"I bought this pareo for a new 'aparima class at my halau and it's amazing. I've gotten compliments from my dance sisters, and the material holds up well. Definitely recommend!"
5567,"It was even prettier in person if you can believe it! (Got the Maroon) Might get more just to wear around in the 100+ degree weather we get here in the summer, in addition to what I actually got it for."
5568,"Beautiful pareo. Very accurate images of the color and pattern, and in person the quality of the fabric is clear. Great experience with Sue: professional, efficient, gracious. I had a tight time frame and got the pareo in plenty of time. Love it. Thanks Sue!"
5569,"Greetings! My sister LOVES her pareo! Thank you for the speedy delivery. Thanks for your notes, too! Happy Easter! Betsy Comer"
5570,I LOVE THE MATERIAL AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. WILL DEFF ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN
5571,Beautiful!
5572,Love the colors and how soft the fabric is!
5573,Beautiful!  I love it.  Thank you!
5574,I actually bought this in black and grey and love It!
5575,"Fits beautifully. Great quality, fast shipping. I am 5ft 7in 140 lbs. I have small breast and big booty lol,  Small top medium bottoms are perfect. Looks hot with a good tan!"
5576,"Thank you, I love them!"
5577,"Thank you, I love them!"

Thank you so much."
5582,"It's nice and big , bright. Nice"
5583,AMAZING in every way!  Feeling confident and sassy for my milestone birthday trip now!  Thank you!
5584,Such a cute bottom...fits perfectly! Thank u very much!
5585,"Fits fine but wish went higher like shown in pictures.. Main reason I chose this particular one was because there looked to have no top stitch but mine does, which makes it too tight just there. Crotch area kinda messy and very thin but luckily doesn't show anything."
5586,"Don’t go elsewhere! This is exactly what you’re looking for! these are high-quality wonderfully made masks!  They fit very nicely, as this seller customizes the sizing of these masks for you.  They are also so pretty!  I am so happy to have found this seller!  She is absolutely fantastic to work with. I had a couple of issues early on because of my own mistake with sizing and she was very professional and quick to assist me with a great solution. I couldn’t be more pleased. She will definitely be getting business from me in the future!"
5587,"The mask was perfect fit and my son loved how breathable it was ! Thanks! 
😷"
5588,"Love it!!!
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!
10 Star Seller!!!

5591,The items are exactly what is was hoping for.

5593,It's very beautiful !
5594,"so awesome, and made to fit me perfectly!"

5601,"Great communication, cute top, well made, quick shipping. Thank you."
5602,"didn't look great with the pads, you could really see them - would have liked them better without."
5603,Shipping was super fast.
5604,"I wanted to support smaller businesses when I was looking for a new swimsuit so I decided to look on Etsy and found Lucy’s shop! I love that I could pick my colors and even message her with my measurements.  This suit is so perfect, doesn’t dig in and was worth every penny"
5605,This was exactly what I was looking for! I love the cut of the bottoms and the shade of nude! It’s a perfect suit for my honeymoon! ❤️❤️❤️
5606,I got this in red and camo print. The red looks amazing on me and I love it so much. The camo looks jus as cute but is jus slightly smaller in the bottoms so u may not be able to wear it at work but I will still rock it anyway!
5607,"The personal attention was very unexpected and great, the sizing was perfect to my body as well as on time for summer."
5608,Fits perfect ! I love it :)
5609,Great looking Bikini....was a gift for my wife and she loved it!!!  Lisa was great also helping me with the two million questions that I had.  Great quality and great looking!
5610,perfect! i ordered this in a coral color and i LOVE it! can't wait to wear it!
5611,Very nicely made and looks wonderful...wife loved it....I (husband)scored some points for the purchase..highly recommend.  Very helpful and answered all of my questions
5612,Amazing item! Fit wonderfully and arrived surprisingly fast! I'm so pleased! Thank you!
5613,The pink is a very light pale pink.  Pretty
5614,So sexy! My future husband will have a hard time keeping his hands off me!
5615,It fit my wife like a glove (a very small glove). More than a thong but less than a bikini.  Very good craftsmanship.
5616,This is very cute on. However the top is not padded which isn't a huge issue but just thought it should be noted!
5617,Fast shipping.  Great service.  Thank you!
5618,"These bottoms are amazing!! JoEllen had me fill out some measurements about myself and let me know which size would fit best, and she even made sure I would receive them before my vacation! They fit great and are super comfortable, I'm obsessed."
5619,I absolutely love this bathing suit bottom!  It fits so well and is extremely flattering.  Exactly what I was looking for!!  Can't wait to buy more.  I live in California and have yet to find a good suit like this one.  This etsy store is a GEM!
5620,Fits like a dream! I couldn't recommend this shop more!
5621,This is the best fitting bikini I've ever owned! It's exactly what I was looking for and exactly as described/pictured! Purchased it with the matching sliding halter neck bikini top and it looks great!
5622,Perfect bikini bottom for my body type. THANK YOU!
5623,"My only complaint is that the seams don’t lay flat with the rest of the garment. They scrunch up and can dent into your skin when stretched out. However, the shop owner was nice and the fabric is quality!"
5624,"Shipping was fast, item was exactly as I expected! Great quality, Will order again soon!"
5625,These are the absolute best fitting swimsuit bottoms I have EVER had. Super comfortable and VERY flattering. I'll be buying more!
5626,"As usual I am totally satisfied with my order. Not only I am in love with the design, the quality is perfect. This is the 3rd the swimwear I order and I can’t stop, and the knit doesn’t get heavy in contact with the water. Big plus for the saler Dragana she is amazing ❤️"
5627,Corona deff took its time letting these masterpieces get to me but they all fit perfect and are made perfectly !!! I’m ready to buy more
5628,"I am in AWE with the beauty of this bikini. The most beautiful piece i own, hands down. Recommend 1000000% and i will definitely be purchasing more soon."
5629,"This has been my dream bikini for a while and it has exceeded my expectations, high quality and great communication with seller ! Will purchase again ❤️"
5630,Perfect fit thank you so much
5631,Can't say enough about GAGA's work...  She is beyond amazing!!!
5632,Shipping was as expected which I appreciate. The sarong looks like it is in the picture. Absolutely beautiful really! Material is thinner than the older sarongs I've had but it should work nicely in the heat. breathable. Thank you much!
5633,So soft and beautiful. like a precious tattoo of life and death. Wearable Art at it's finest!
5634,"I dig this shop. Good quality, arrived quickly from the other side of the world! Thanks!"
5635,"I like it very much...shipping was in time....
I recommended to everyone."
5636,Versatile piece. Unique and as described
5637,"Paréo mais aussi une écharpe, bravo vraiment de très beau articles👍👏👍👏👍👏👍"
5638,"Amazing!!!!! Love this suit! I have been drying for one that looks good on my body. One piece but still sexy! I am very curvy so most one pieces make me look fat. This is brilliant! Great quality and so well made! I am a returning customer and will continue to be! Lucy is so quick with answering questions! Shipping was so fast! Just let her know what and when you need it, and wa-la you got it!!!"
5639,"I Love Love Love my swimsuit. Customer service is excellent, product is excellent and great quality. Was able to custom order my swimsuit at night and it was shipped the next day. extremely fast shipping and response! I LOVE this  vendor and will definitely be getting all my swimsuits from here!  Thanks again!"
5640,Absolutely love it!  I'm a thicker fit girl and having the sling type suit gives me the stretch where I need it but comes in tight at my waist.  I'm going to order another 💖💖
5641,"Pretty beautiful swimsuit, very good workmanship, the material is in top quality, only a pity that the back is not made as a Thong."
5642,"Wonderful!! This seller is an amazing, very warm and helpful person, I had a really lovely shopping experience with her! And I would come back anytime! I used this Sarong in LA in the Hollywood hills and it was a perfect cover up for me! Thank you so very much xx"
5643,love it!!
5644,So beautiful!  Feels amazing to the touch.  Thank you!
5645,Even more beautiful in person!
5646,"I love it, it is beautiful. De delivery was on time nothing for me to complaint about. Thank you ??"
5647,"Lovely and perfect for me, B"
5648,Even prettier in person.  Shipped fast.  Thanks!
5649,I bought this for a gift...the recipient loves these colors and i know she will enjoy this as she winters in Florida!
5650,Thank you from PinkPurr! I'll be back!
5651,"Perfect and arrived quickly, thank you!"
5652,Thanks so much for the FAST shipping!
5653,"so perfect!! shipped quickly. the bottoms were a little lower than I expected (below belly button)  but still super cute. Ordered an XS, I'm a 32B and got the top altered to fit perfectly. love how metallic it actually turned out & good quality!"
5654,"Highly recommend, the bottoms fit perfectly! hugged my curves n lovehandles well! AHHH definitely will b buying again!"
5655,"Shipped quickly, amazing quality."
5656,Not only did I get great customer service I am getting a beautiful bikini. I really love the Fabric as it does not feel as stiff and is easy to move in. The top provides a bit of a push up that is very flattering. I ordered a size to big for the top and I was able to exchange it for a small with no problem. I will order another in the future.
5657,"I love everything about my new bikini! I was looking for interesting design and I found exactly what I was looking for. Vicky was even able to make a small customizations for me - add a little more sparkle to the suit and change middle connector for me ! 
Honestly , I was a little skeptical about buying a bikini online, but I have absolutely no regrets after all:) Already planning to order another suit from Vicky !"
5658,Loved my suit from Vicky Ross Fit. It was beautiful and the color stood out from the rest. Vicky made sure I had a beautiful suit and helped me out so much with questions on my order. I received the suit very quickly in the mail and I will definitely make another purchase from her.
5659,The fit is perfect! It's better than I imagined. I'm so excited to wear this for my first competition!
5660,I liked the rainbow crystals.  It arrived chef in time.
5661,"I got this in black, size small. It's made well.  I was worried it wouldn't fit, being too big, as many times clothing isn't labeled accurately. It is actually small, which is good! It does hold in my 34C bust and the bottoms are flatteringly tiny. I'm 5'7"" and approximately 130 lbs. I generally wear a size 2-4 (depending on designer).  It's just as pictured!"
5662,"I absolutely love this bathing suit. I ordered a coral one last year and loved it so much I ordered another one in emerald. It’s perfect! I’m 5’6, 32B bust, and 120 lbs. I ordered a small."
5663,"I love my new bikini <3 The attention to detail is absolutely amazing! You can tell how much work and craftsmanship went into making it.
It doesn't stretch in the water and is very comfortable even without any lining. The yellow is a very pretty mustard yellow.
I didn't give exact measurements, but the bikini is true to size and fits nicely.
Great communication with the seller. I would definitely consider buying again from Julia!"
5664,"Most beautiful bikini I've ever had :-) Great quality and lovely design. The crochet is very solid, keeps its shape in the water and even shapes your body. The white one, of course, is very delicate and gets easily dirty, so I would recommend not to use it as your main bikini. Still, definitely worthy and recommended!"
5665,"The packaging was great, and given the distance it arrived when described. There's a lot of craftsmanship that must of went into it. It fit me well and looks thick enough. I haven't used it yet. 

Feedback I did have would be to make the bottom strings a bit longer on the sides, they are very short to tie."
5666,Toller Bikini. Sehr gerne wieder.
5667,Wunderschöner Bikini. Immer wieder gerne. Vielen Dank.
5668,It s very beautiful.
5669,"Really nice and very good quality, thanks a lot. My girlfriend well love it."
5670,Great product! Arrived on time and Maria was very responsive. Thank you!
5671,Alles top. Super Qualität und Verarbeitung. Kann man nur weiter empfehlen. Top Service und sehr netter individueller Kontakt.
5672,Love the lining feature!
5673,Pom is so helpful and makes sure you're happy with your purchase. All etsy sellers should be like her!!! Thank you!
5674,Love it so much! She was extremely helpful and shipped it right away! Thanks so much :)
5675,Lining works perfectly. Hides everything.
5676,Quality add on. Very comfortable and seamless.
5677,The lining is definitely worth the couple extra bucks :)
5678,It is great to have this option . i bought lining for the bikini too. very happy with them ;)
5679,Lining made the top much more comfortable to wear
5680,"In my opinion it's needed for all the swimwear items  , looks great!"
5681,I felt like it gave my monokini a better coverage for my chest
5682,You are freaking amazing!! Thank you so much!! I love me suit so much💙💙
5683,Little tight but gorgeous!
5684,"This suit is the prettiest bathing suit I have ever seen. I love it so much, it fits perfectly, the fabric is amazing, and what to say about Kerry, the seller ? She is a wonderful person, and the entire world should know about her and her shop ! Thank you again Kerry 💗"
5685,"I love my swimsuit so much! I received so many compliments and already, girls are telling me that they're also going to purchase from Bikiniboo! The delivery was so fast and service was on point. I'm totally considering my next purchase ;)"
5686,This is by far the cutest bathing suit I've ever owned! The cut is so flattering and slimming. The pattern is so lovely too. Now I want one in all patterns!
5687,"Super cute print! At first I thought the suit fit awkwardly but I've gotten lots of compliments so it may have been because I've never worn a suit like this before. This is definitely a lounging bathing suit or for relaxing in the pool. In my experience, anything more than that shifted the fabric so I was exposed."
5688,It’s gorgeous and I love it! The seller was excellent with communication which was really helpful as there were some difficulties with postage on Australia Posts End.
5689,LOVE it! Custom in that she extended the straps since I wear a DD bra. So sweet and easy to work with.
5690,What a great shop! Items shipped very quickly and the quality is outstanding! Prints and sizes are exactly as advertised! Definitely would order again!
5691,"Suit fit so nicely, I love the pattern so much! Very nicely packaged:)"
5692,This bikini top rocks - it fits perfectly and is sooo very comfortable.  I had no problem wearing it to the Tortuga festival in Lauderdale all day- dancing to the songs - jumping up and down and nothing slipped out.  Who can say that about bikini tops these days?  I got a ton of compliments.  The customer service and responses to my questions were immediate and wonderful.  I received my top and bottom in time for my trip.  She went above and beyond and I can't thank her enough.  I can't wait to work with her on more bikinis bc they fit and they are comfortable- win - win- win -- all the way around.  I got the padding added and the pads are not gigantic pads like VS - the padding is light and thin and not thick padding.  Perfect padding.  I can't wait to order more bikinis from her. Enjoy everyone!
5693,"Love the top itself, but the seller was a bit snotty with me. I asked her if I could get it by a certain date (two weeks out) and she said yes, no problem, but didn't tell me I had to order it THAT DAY... So when I did order it she scolded me and told me she'd have to work overtime... to get me a tiny pice of fabric. It did get to me on time, but next time include ""yes, if you order it by [date]"""
5694,Exactly as pictured. Good quality. Will warn - int'l shipping + customs charges are rude ( not fault of seller )
5695,"She took the measurements I gave her and made a beautiful custom suit for me. We vacationed in Maui and I cannot count how many compliments I received...asking me where I got it! Lucy Bea on Etsy, of course!!! 💓💕💞"
5696,Love all of my swimsuits from Lucy. Look forward to buying a new one every Summer! She is so talented & def the best! Everyone always compliments all of my suits each year. 😁
5697,"This is probably one of the best bathing suits I have ever owned! The top is super comfortable and supportive with my DDD bust. There is zero pressure around the back of my neck to hold up the girls, and the fabric is extra lined so nothing shows through. I asked for the bottom to have a slightly higher rise, and it is the perfect fit. I love everything about this swimsuit, because it hides my flaws, while accentuating my favorite parts. Very well made and I am looking forward to rocking it in Vegas next week! Thank you so much for this fabulous bikini, and I will be ordering again soon!"
5698,"Thank you!  My suit arrived in time for my honeymoon just as you promised. 
The fit is perfect!"
5699,"The swimsuit was exactly what I ordered. Right color, size, fit great. Very pleased with the product itself. It came later than I expected, with a few mishaps, buy the swimsuit itself is great quality and a good purchase."
5700,"Absolutely the best purchase of a swimsuit ever! Well worth the money! Excellent quality, design, and fit! It did take some time to receive the swimsuit, but that was stated upon purchase, as it was made to order. I will definitely order from  this shop again!!"
5701,2nd suit I've ordered and couldn't be happier!!! Lucy I appreciate your easy communication & speedy shipping. Thank you❤️❤️
5702,Can't wait to wear it on my cruise this summer!
5703,Perfection. And super attentive customer service. Thank you!
5704,Very pleased with my purchase. Suit fit great. Top notch.
5705,"First the ""ok"": I wish this bathing suit was higher on my chest. It's Got deep cleavage but I can deal with that. 

Second the love:

Gave Heather my measurements (I'm a curvy tall lady) she hit the mark! A big Thank you for taking them into account. 

Also, I messed up on a measurement on the skirt ( I needed more cover up for my huge ba dunk a dunk ) and she fixed my mistake and sent me a new skirt piece right before my vacation (which I totally needed) you've saved me!!

Thank you 💜💜💜
Thank you 😘😘😘😘
Thank you 💋💋💋💋
!!!!Heather you rock!!!!!💃💃💃"
5706,"I absolutely LOVE this suit!  Quality fabric, lined and fits me very well.  I got it in teal with red polka dots, and couldn't be happier. In fact I love it so much, I'm getting one for my daughter!  
Will definitely shop here again"
5707,This suit is cute but I thought it was all one piece. Not sure if I can pull this off.
5708,Love my new suit!  The retro style is perfect for me and the skirt adds the modesty I have been searching for.  Great quality - the suit is fully lined.  It shipped faster than I expected - I can't wait to use it this summer!  My husband loves it on me too!
5709,Super flattering!! Love the cut. Shipped very quickly!
5710,"I like the style, print and design. However, no cup support for the chest area."
5711,"I love this bikini so much!!! I am a huge Spider-Man fan and I've been looking everywhere for a nice spidey bikini but I 
could never find one. Until I found this one and I fangirled like crazy both when I found it and when I received it. It's a really nice set very comfy the colors don't bleed and the shop owner is really sweet. She helped me reship it when I forgot to put the apt number on it. And she's really kind. I would recommend buying from her and will be doing so myself. :)"
5712,Love all the swimsuits I’ve purchased from this shop. Great quality and fun superhero options!
5713,Love!!
5714,Amazing! love this bikini!!! so comfortable! gah words cant describe this bikin!
5715,AMAZING!!!
5716,I am so in love with this swim suit! It fits perfectly and was quick shipping. Thank you!
5717,Very fast ship and delivery..item is in great condition and what i ordered
5718,"Shipping was timely.  It is the sexiest swimsuit my girlfriend wears, period. Quality and fit are spot on. I don't know who likes it more, her or me, but is both of our favorite. Thanks"
5719,Great service. Love my spidey suit! Fits just right.
5720,Great quality work and amazing owner that gets back with you when you have any questions.
5721,I LOVE IT! The seller was fantastic
5722,"Excellent quality product, great customer service, and VERY fast!"
5723,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Greek flag bikini bottoms just as much as the top. Got the regular style without the scrunching. True to size fit, very nice material, excellent stitching. I'm even thinking of ordering another bottom in a different style!"
5724,Looks amazing!! Just like the picture!
5725,Didn't realize it was only store credit not a full refund.
5726,"First off the pre purchase experience was fantastic with Pamela. I am horrible at buying my wife clothes so I was taking a big gamble on a custom swim suit she would actually wear. I showed Pam photos of other bikinis my wife owned and and we settled on style (triangle top and string bottoms with ruching) and size. We needed to out cute another couple on at least one day of vacation and these suits put us over the top. We got compliments from strangers on the suits. and I might get a best husband nomination this year when awards season comes around. My trucks fit perfectly and have two side pockets and a rear pocket. I could do without the liner but love having pockets. My wife "" The pattern is cute, and the fit, perfect."" Thanks Pamela."
5727,"We loved them! And the seller! I was freaking out and she made sure they were here by the time I left for Bahamas! Thank you!! 
& we got sooo many compliments! ❤️"
5728,Absolutely amazing quality bathing suits and custom service! The cheeky bottom was a little too cheeky for me and I leave for my destination wedding in a week so I immediately email them and they got right back to me and rush ordered me a new bottom!
5729,Mine and my husbands suits fit perfectly. I gave our measurements and photos of a specific style suit I wanted and they knocked it out of the park! Very well made!
5730,Very good quality and  fabric. The front pockets of the swimshorts are very shallow so you can’t really put anything in there because they will fall for sure. Other than that my fiancée is very happy with her two piece excited to wear them out together. In all fairness the delay on the shipping ws because of the winter storm that hit the USA as they come from Colombia.
5731,Received in a timely manner. Both mine and my boyfriends were true to size. The print was fabulous and the style just what I expected. The quality of the material was also good. Would recommend!
5732,Bought this for my fiancé and I to take with us on our honeymoon because who doesn’t want to be matchy matchy cute?! High quality material and great company. I’m clueless when it comes to figuring out sizes or swimsuit types and Pamela was a great help!
5733,Bathing a suit came beautifully packaged! They fit perfect. I am so excited to wear them for our beach trip.
5734,"Absolutely obsessed with my husband and my matching swimsuits. The quality is amazing. I have a very hard time finding swimsuits I love, and I have NEVER risked ordering one online before due to my pickiness. When they arrived they were so perfect. Great quality and exactly what I wanted!! Thank you!!!"
5735,"Cute bathing suit. Good fit.
Not good experience with the shipping. Buy in advance. Consider a couple months if you're planning to have them for something important. No real expedite option"
5736,Really great quality! Can't wait to wear these on our vacation!
5737,"My husband’s swim trunks were nice. I was sent the wrong size bottoms and didn’t have enough time before our trip to ask for a replacement, and the top was the correct size, but ill-fitting. My friend who ordered the same style top felt the same way. Disappointing overall."
5738,Very nice well made items! I can't wait to wear these with hubby on our anniversary vacation!
5739,I sized up in the ruffle bottoms but they are still really skimpy. But super cute and well made.
5740,"The initial bathing suits were mixed up in a different order to the owner, so I did not receive the suits by the original agreed upon date. The owner kindly offer a partial discount and was able to rush ship them a week late. Swimsuits themselves are nice - the women's one piece fits well. The men's suit had one error (wrong color waistband), but fit well. The white pattern is slightly see through on the men's suit. Overall cute suits and good value, and I would order from this shop again - just leave plenty of time for shipping (multiple weeks / at least a month)."
5741,Well made and great quality!
5742,"The suits are fantastic don’t get me wrong. However, due to the corona virus the shipment was delayed. Trust me I get it, everything is up in the air right now. The problem is I asked the designer to ship them to a different address since they would be delayed so that I could get it to my boyfriend before his birthday. She agreed to do that yet still sent them to my old address...I had to pay $50 to send them to the correct address and my boyfriend didn’t get his present till a week late. The hassle was not worth it."
5743,This vendor did not deliver as promised but did refund immediately. I found out I was not receiving my order 2 days prior to the date we both agreed to. Very frustrating!!
5744,"They fit amazing . I got a size large my hip size is 42 , & my  waist is about a 28-29 . In love will be ordering more"
5745,I bought this for my wife for our vacation to Mexico. She looked incredibly sexy in it and it fit her perfectly!
5746,I love it. It's super sexy and the fit is right on point. If you are a small get a small  ;D
5747,"It's exactly as pictured, fits perfectly and I'm sooo in love with it!! Now I want these in every colour LOL."
5748,"My husband adored this piece when I wore it on our honeymoon. I ordered larger than I typically do, but it ended up fitting great!"
5749,Super cute swim suit bottom. Looks just like the picture. Love it! Seller is responsive and helpful!
5750,"I am in LOOOOOOVEEEEE!!
Will 100000% buy from Ashley again. Her bikinis are so cute, they fit perfectly and they arrived soooo fast!!"
5751,I love the way it fits!
5752,"Lovely, thanks. Krisa is going to love wearing this, I'll send you shots when we're done next month"
5753,The Rosie is a fantastic Bikini! It fits just like the picture and it is very well made.
5754,Absolutely perfect. Couldn't have asked for a better product and made wonderfully. Would recommend this seller to everyone xx
5755,it's so snug and comfy
5756,"Fits perfectly, super sexy! Arrived before it was planned to as well. No issues whatsoever. I will absolutely be doing business with this seller again!"
5757,Great fit! Amazing and comfortable material. Great shipping.
5758,Very sexy bottoms that fit nicely
5759,Fast and reliable seller. Sexy thong good fit. 👍🌹
5760,"I unfortunately can not comment on the bathing suits because I never received them. Order was shipped much later then when they marked it as shipped. Never received tracking and when I inquired about the whereabouts of my order I received a tracking number a couple of days later. The item was shown that it was delivered (the week before) but I did not get it. Because it was so long ago, there was not much I could do. Seller refused to assist in the process of filing a claim with USPS and I can not file one without them. I am very unhappy with this transaction and the fact that I am out over $100 with no attempted resolution on the sellers behalf. I have since order bathing suits elsewhere."
5761,Absolutely loved them all girls looked so put together ... The color match the wedding perfectly !!!! Thank you so much !!!
5762,"I bought these as favors for a bachelorette party and the girls LOVED them!  They were comfortable, lightweight, and the length was perfect."
5763,This is very cute. I bought it for my granddaughter for her graduation trip. I love it. Very fast shipping. Will be ordering from this shop again!!
5764,I ordered these for myself & bridal party.  They are so cute and the stitching of the monogrammed initials looks perfect!  I can't wait to give these to my girls!
5765,Love the monogrammed beach cover up. Just Perfect!!!
5766,So comfy! Sized up from small to medium and glad I did.
5767,I gave this cover up to my nieces and they loved them!!!
5768,So pretty and exactly what I wanted!!
5769,Love it! Great material for a swim suit cover up
5770,"Very well made. Smaller than I thought, so you may want to size up."
5771,"Sizing not S-M-L as listed is
S/M
Disappointed"
5772,I was think this cover-up was a different material but other than that it was as described:)
5773,I couldn't be happier!!!!! I love love love this top!!! Great communication by the seller! I cant wait for my vacation!
5774,Easy communication and fast shipping. The seamless material is so nice and high quality. Seems like he small fits more like a medium for the top which was perfect for me.
5775,Very comfortable and clean lined bikini!!!!!!
5776,So comfortable! I love it...I had to buy two different colors!
5777,So comfortable! I love it...I had to buy two different colors!
5778,"I am just so impressed with Kerry and her adorable swimsuits! She was so easy to work with--I initially ordered the wrong size and she promptly got me the right size in the mail.  The quality of the suit is fantastic, and it's such a fun design.  No one else has anything like it! I am over the moon, and so happy I purchased from her."
5779,"Absolutely the best on piece I have. Considering all of mine are designer, I think this seller should know the one I received is my go to now. I will be buying more!! Gotta shop. ttfn (ta ta for now)"
5780,Absolutely beautiful and super well-made swimming costume. Great service - Kerry was really friendly and helpful when I messaged her with measurements (and the size seems to be spot on!) Can't wait to wear it in the Dead Sea on my holiday! Looking forward to buying another from Kerry soon!
5781,"I love my swimsuit! I am 5'2"" and weigh 135 lbs with a D cup and the large suit fit perfectly - Thank you Kerry for helping me determine the correct size😊 I am so excited to wear it during my upcoming vacation. Can't wait to order my next suit!!!"
5782,"Such a fun design! A bit more snug than I expected, so if you're on the fence I suggest sizing up. So fun to wear and no nip slips which is always a WIN! Great service and quick shipment."
5783,"L O V E this swimsuit!!! It fits perfectly, super flattering and the best part is it can double as a body suit underneath jeans or shorts! Love it!!! Thank you!!"
5784,The seller was honestly one of the best sellers I have ever worked with! Very sweet and after mentioning how badly I wanted this suit (but my size was sold out) she let me know ASAP when it was back in stock. The quality of this suit is AMAZING and I feel SO good in it.
5785,"Absolutely love this suit! Very comfortable (but thick) material. I am 5'2"", 110 lbs with pretty muscular legs and C cup bra size, and the Small fits perfectly. With my bra size there is enough coverage, but I have to be careful not to expose anything. Would highly recommend this suit!!!"
5786,"Beautiful swim suit, so retro!"
5787,"Very cute and flattering. Some extra fabric on the butt area, so it curls over at the waist area which is a pain, but it was worth it!"
5788,Beautiful. As described. Just not right for my body.
5789,"Absolutely beautiful print, and phenomenal material! This swimsuit is super flattering, and makes me feel enormously confident! Customer service was impeccable (heck Kerry May be my new BFF in my head)! I will certainly purchase again, and will of course recommend to others."
5790,"Second suit I've bought from this store, and I got SO many compliments on it. I ended up giving this suit to my sister (who is 5'4) since I felt that the straps were a bit too short for my 5'8 frame. It likewise looks great on her, and I will most likely contact the shop in the near future to see if the straps can be adjusted!"
5791,"Love this suit and am already planning to buy more in various patterns. I love this material, as it is very thick and the texture is great. Very pleased customer, thank you for this beautiful piece!"
5792,Beautiful swimsuit! It didn't fit me perfectly around the thighs but that was more of a product of my body than my swimsuit. Super friendly and responsive ??
5793,"Super joli, super sexy, un peu rétro, j'adore!"
5794,"SUPER cute, very comfortably fitted, and great lightweight fabric! Barely feels like a swimsuit, in the best possible way! Will definitely order from Kerry again :)"
5795,Fits super well and is super pretty
5796,Love this suit!! Such a statement piece. It's definitely going to be more of a trendy suit than active suit but I'm okay with that! Will probably have to use some double sided tape to make sure it stays in place on the top. So cute and unique. It shipped out the very next day too!
5797,J’aime enfin être en maillot ! Tout est dit...
5798,I love this suit! So well-made and absolutely adorable.
5799,A beautiful bathing suit from the nicest person I've ever contacted on Etsy. And it came a week earlier then it was supposed to! :)
5800,"I am 5'9"" , 150lbs, ordered size L Tall. It fits great! The seller was very communicative and it arrived quickly. Hope to order another suit at some point."
5801,Fits well and is even cuter in person!
5802,"Loooooove it!  Classic, sexy, comfortable."
5803,"Found the lining little loose needed to fiddle around to put in place 
Very nice swimsuit for my next holiday"
5804,Fits perfectly. Super comfortable
5805,"Great quality, thick and comfortable feeling. I bought it for a friend as a gift. It looks so absolutly darling on her and she is in love with it"
5806,"La forme, la matière, tout est top !
Et merci à Kerry pour ses conseils de choix de taille."
5807,"Arrived in a very timely manner. Fits perfectly, very well made."
5808,The two way pattern on the bottom is very flattering.
5809,Cute swimsuit. Not much support for the ladies though.
5810,LOVE THIS SUIT. I am 5’3” and 158. I’m a 36 B and am about a US size 8 right now. I got a medium top and a large bottom because I’m a little extra on the bottom! It fits so great! Will definitely be buying more suits soon!! I felt confident and very pretty ❤️❤️❤️.
5811,"FINALLY. A high-waisted pinup style swimsuit that actually delivers! Bikinis can be depressing after having a couple kids, but not this baby! It's gorgeous and soft and so so so flattering. I might be a little obsessed now. I also might need about 5 more in every color. 😍😍😍"
5812,I love this suit! She was so nice and helpful and totally worked with me on sizes. I can't wait until it's a little warmer to show it off. It's so flattering and I haven't felt that way about bathing suit bottoms in a really long time. Thank you!!!
5813,"I love my new suit. Kerry was very accommodating when I needed to exchange this one, and even sent an extra suit when the first went to the wrong address (long story). Needless to say, not only is this suit lovely and impeccably made, but Kerry is a kind person who goes above and beyond when it comes to making sure folks are happy. Buy a swimsuit from her, she's lovely and her swimsuits are gorgeous!"
5814,"This is a great retro suit. The high waist hits my body at the perfect spot (smallest part); and its flattering rouching is appreciated. I am an 8/29 jean size, ordered the medium bottom. I am a 34D so I asked for a large top. The top unfortunately doesn't support my girls at all, but I can wear a strapless bra underneath and have the swimsuit conceal it. Hopefully everything stays in place once I hit the water!"
5815,"This swimming suit is worth every penny! Such wonderful quality, very comfortable, and looks absolutely great when you try it on, not only that but the owner of the shop is very sweet, and very helpful. I love this swimming suit!  : )"
5816,Wow ! What an amazing piece of swim wear. Thank you for making me feel confident!
5817,"Perfect! Kerry was very friendly and helpful picking the right size. She shipped it fast for me, so it was in time for my lastminute trip to the sun. Bikini is not only swimming-proof, but even Aquagym-proof. Great! I am already trying to decide which print I want next ;)"
5818,Absolutely LOVE my new suit. Even more than the one piece I bought last year- and I didn't think that was possible! I can't imagine buying my suits anywhere else!
5819,"Top quality and prettiness this bikini says it all. Best materials and best practices make this a slimming swimsuit to admire. 
The owner is always close by to lend a helping and professional few words, on the friendly side of  course.
Take you choice of cloth and take your sunbed....before someone else does!"
5820,Kerry is amazing!!!! I absolutely love the swim suit! Definitely will be buying from her again :).
5821,"I'd read a lot of reviews saying that these were great swimsuits for girls with curvier figures and bits and bobs they'd prefer to have flattered. I was feeling particularly unfit and unconfident in my body before I went on holiday this summer, but this swimsuit was perfect. It covered what I wanted covered but made me feel cool and sexy and different.

My measurements put me at the higher end of a M or the smaller end of L. I went for a large but I probably could have got a medium as there was a bit of room to spare (though not enough to make me think about returning it).

The fabric was quite thick so a little hot on the more warmer days, but not too bad. The thicker fabric and the longer line of the top meant that I felt comfortable wearing it with a high waisted skirt away from the pool. 

Throughly recommend. A great buy."
5822,"Absolutely fab, as described and fits well 😁"
5823,"Lovely vintage fit, and good quality. It washed really well after my holiday. One thing to note - the top is a tie back so there is a bulky knot when worn under clothes. The extra fabric ties also gets in the way a bit, would love a version with a clasp."
5824,"Excellent communication as always. This is my second purchase from Bikiniboo and Kerry has been so quick to dispatch items. With this purchase I wanted to exchange the top size as I’d ordered too large, this process was so easy. I’ll definitely be back for more 👙
Bikiniboo costumes and bikinis are the most comfortable swimwear I have ever worn! I wouldn’t go anywhere else now x"
5825,"GORGEOUS suit. I will have to post photos when it gets warmer out. I love the fit, soft material and design. The shoppe owner responded right away and gave me great advice regarding sizing. I will definitely order here again!"
5826,"This bikini is SO flattering! The ruching across the tummy is very complimentary 😊 and the bottoms don’t dig into your tummy, thighs or seat. The top supports well and is so pretty!
Overall, this suit is a must 😍
And a BIG thank you to Kerry for being so kind and ensuring that my suit arrived in time for a special occasion. You are so kind 🥰"
5827,Super happy with my new bikini! Thank you xx
5828,"LOVE LOVE LOVE, This swimsuit.  It fits great. Lovely quality and great service... absolutely would order again from Bikiniboo......"
5829,Love this bathing suit! Super comfortable and well made. It’s better than I expected!
5830,Super sauber verarbeitet. Wie abgebildet. Total klasse
5831,Fits great and very flattering!
5832,"Super flattering and comfortable, well made bikini. Thank you!"
5833,"size is accurate, lovely bikini"
5834,"Product as promised. Highly recommend. Sizing, cut and colour all perfect."
5835,Fantastic job! It can be hard to find bikinis that fit just right in generic sizes. Mine fits like a glove and is super rad to boot... Worth the price; amazing bathing suit!
5836,"This is a beautifully made bikini and for an amazing price. Made exactly to my measurements, this is the very first string bikini I have ever been able to wear without the fear of a boob popping out the side!! The bottoms were even made to my specifications (still sexy but a little higher cut to cover a not so sexy C-section scar) If you are in the mood for a little geektastic bikini for the next convention or even just to show your fandom, I highly recommend purchasing one.

What any self respecting engineering officer needs after a long day with the away team to soak in the spa."
5837,"Great bathing suit, fits well and made of quality material. Very nice bathing suit! 
It did get trapped in customs for 2.5 weeks but it was shipped on time. Putting ""merchandise"" on the label meant it cost me an extra $20 to receive and is possibly why it was held up so long as customs then had to open it and process it further."
5838,"Sexy and stringy, as advertised!"
5839,"Excellent quality, perfect fit, very satisfied"
5840,Fits good and shipped very fast. :)
5841,"Fast delivery, product as described"
5842,"My wife while not a phan of phish loves the bikini... I'll be contacting the seller to see of he can get some in solid prints... sexy (me as a husband's take), but comfortable (my wife) and is great to swim in"
5843,This bathing suit is AMAZING!  And was shipped to me literally immediately!  Thank you so much!  Happy summer tour :)
5844,Super cute!!! Can’t wait to wear in Mexico!
5845,Cute but top runs smaller than the bottom and the combination of elastic to cloth is not meant for big breasted women. But they were a very nice company to work with as far as a exchanges and understanding me as a customer.
5846,Fits SO WELL I’m actually in love.... once I received it I immediately wanted to order more 😍
5847,Although this took awhile to get here I’m sooooooooooooooo pleased. Made BANK in this and every dude I danced for complimented me on how sexy yet classy my outfit was. First day shift was a complete and total success in this outfit ❤️❤️❤️❤️
5848,Ummmm don’t hesitate. Just press buy bc this outfit was so pretty on! I am in love 🥰🥰🥰
5849,It took about a week after i paid for it to ship but other than that it’s great quality and i got a lot of compliments on it . My piercings show through and looks very cute . I love this outfit it fits great
5850,One of my favorite outfits I own now! Love it so much such a perfect fit!
5851,Very well made Loved the fit makes your waist smaller just great! Washed it and the stones are still intact the seller was very responsive and shipping was fast.
5852,"This outfit is beautiful, the quality is excellent as well. The shop owner worked with all my needs, and I’m so thankful! Definitely recommend!!"
5853,Fits perfectly and super good quality! Definitely my favorite outfit.
5854,Love it! Perfect fit & just as I expected thanks!
5855,"thank you! this fit me perfectly, super cute"
5856,Fits perfectly like always.
5857,super cute and easy! shipped within the time it was supposed to!
5858,love this! thank you
5859,Fits nice. no complaints. Got compliments
5860,"So cute! Great quality. I'm 34"" around the bust and am flat chested. Bought the M, it's perfect!"
5861,This is the cutest top. Love!
5862,perfect thank you so much
5863,It arrived very quick and it fit me perfectly. Thank you!
5864,"Very cute, the color is awesome."
5865,"Shipped quickly! Looks like the photo, great condition"
5866,fits great and arrived quickly! thank you!
5867,This suit turned out to be a little big but over all great bathing suit and fast delivery
5868,"So happy with our purchase! We decided to have an 80s themed bachelorette and these suits made the perfect leotards for a great price. Each suit had a different phrase and Nadejda custom fit each phrase to several different sized suits. She went above and beyond changing font size so everything looked perfect! The suits also fit great. I can’t speak to how they fit when wet, but the white is slightly see through even when dry. I suggest curvier or long torso women to size up. Thanks so much. The bride was thrilled 🤍"
5869,exactly what we wanted. size is mostly true to size but the straps/torso is long if you’re short.
5870,UPDATE- The seller reached out to me immediately to offer to send an alternate color. Great customer service!! Thank you it’s appreciated!!
5871,Great product but Definitely run small. I would suggest to order the next size up. But bathing suit is great material!
5872,"Very smaller than expected. Good quality, but should order a size or two up."
5873,Sizes dont match size chart. When i messaged her it took days for a response and she expected me to purchase another swimsuit. I dont even feel like wasting any more breath on the poor service. Wont shop here again.
5874,Had issues with the mail and shop gave refund
5875,"Absolutely love this swim suit!  
I feel confident in this swimsuit. 
Made very well. Really fast delivery. 
I'm glad I brought. 
You will too. Treat yourself!!"
5876,Perfect swimsuit!!! Nice fabric. It is worn easily!
5877,"Really cute design and feels like good quality. Delivery was really fast and service was great. My husband loves it on me. Very flattering overall on fuller figure. Only downside was that it fits a bit too short on me because I have a long torso. It would be nice to include the length measurement (maybe it was there and I didn't pay enough attention?). It works on me, but just barely covering what needs to be covered. I'm still giving it 5 stars because I realize that is not going to be an issue for most people."
5878,This one piece is perfect. I feel like I’m wearing nothing! And it’s sexy without having to worry about a wardrobe malfunction
5879,It’s not funny how sexy it is. 🙂 feels good on your skin too
5880,"I have yet to test this suit in the water but it is sexy and fun! There is no gusset though, which would be the one thing I would add to give the suit a little more concealment for lady bits."
5881,Love the material and design
5882,"I LOVE this bathing suit top! I have had a million comments on it already. I bought it for a trip to Las Vegas and I definitely had the cutest bathing suit there. I am a 32D and I bought a medium because I was worried about the front covering enough, and I am glad I did because as it is I probably needed a little more room in the front. When I noticed the top hadn't shipped on time, I messaged the sender and she had it to me two days later! She was  very sweet as well. Definitely recommend!"
5883,Very stiff and not comfortable. Cute in picture but bow won't stay open when I put it on.
5884,"So cute!! Cant wait to wear this in Vegas! Great company, very happy with purchase"
5885,Great customer service and good quality fabric. Very happy with this purchase!
5886,"Perfect, really cute and lightweight. Exactly what I wanted :)"
5887,So cute! Super fast delivery. Only complaint is that it did not bring the warm weather with it to Michigan ;)
5888,Perfect
5889,"Such a beautiful, unique kimono. Very versatile -can be used at the beach or to dress up any casual or semi-formal outfit. Thank you!"
5890,I'm disappointed because I never asked for a refund but she gave me it anyways and never even told me she's was going to do so. I placed an order for a pink kimono and within two weeks it had still not Arrived so I asked the shop owner. She told me it got lost in the drop box and she was going to personally ship my package the next day noon. I notice the same thing is happening again the shipping label is created but another week goes by without it moving. I ask the owner again why and she tells me my order isn't ready yet because she ran out of ties and wouldn't ship if my order isn't complete. after that she refunded me my money without me even asking.
5891,"I LOVE this cover up!! After searching and searching for them online I came across this one just 6 days before my Mexico trip, when I ordered I asked if I would be able to get it in time and Cindy wrote me back saying she would make sure it got sent out that day and that I would have it by Friday! It was in my mailbox Friday morning and is now in my suitcase ready for vacation tomorrow! I'm extremely satisfied and thanks a million to Cindy for getting it to me so fast!"
5892,"This is GORGEOUS! I love it. Seriously want to buy another one already. She customized the fit and length for me, and it came in beautiful wrapping. She really pays attention to detail. This is a MUST buy!"
5893,"Even cuter in person, can't wait to wear this cover up.  Sizing chart was very accurate, thank you!"
5894,Love this! I can't wait to wear it!!
5895,I love my coverup! I felt like a goddess when I put it on and many of my friends said the same thing. One girl was across the pool and noticed me via the coverup before she even realized it was me. It moves so beautifully when I walk. I'll be wearing it probably every time I go to the beach now :-) Thank you so much and thanks for getting it to me on time!!
5896,"Just received this in the mail and the style and fit exceeded expectations. Not only was Sarah very understanding and accommodating to the time frame in which I needed the item, but the cover-up itself was absolutely stunning. I am a mother with my fair share of battle scars on my midsection. This drape allows me to feel sexy in my bikini without feeling self conscious! Thank you Sarah Renee for this beautiful piece and I look forward to purchasing additional pieces in the future!"
5897,Love it so much!!! Thank u!!!!! X
5898,"Absolutely love this. Fantastic quality, fast delivery and looks great. Couldn't ask for more."
5899,"I can’t thank you enough for my custom order of my animal print caftan!  It fits like a glove and I absolutely love it!  Thank you so much, can’t wait for vacation to get started!"
5900,Just like all the other reviews flooding Sarah's website I must also repeat what they have all raved about. Sarah is outstanding with communicating with her customers and providing quality items. I initially wanted two cover-ups for a beach shoot and with only a week's notice I got them in the mail. I will definitely wear them on my Mexico cruise trip this May. Love her store! Thanks Sarah!
5901,"A very cute cover up.  I wasn't anticipating the head hole to be so large, as even the small size falls off my shoulders a lot. But I like the hemline length and the fun sleeves."
5902,"Love it, thanks!"
5903,love the coverup! thanks again!
5904,The item is custom made and flawless. The seller connected with the buyer personally and shipped the item out right away.
5905,"I purchased the bottom in a medium (typically a size 4 but with a big bottom, LOL).  It fits perfectly.  I also purchased the matching top in a small (36A) and that fit perfectly as well.  This is my second purchase.  The items are great quality and customer service is amazing.  Highly recommend."
5906,Awesome buy! I have been looking for a pretty orange bikini for a long time and I finally found one here. The swimsuit fits nicely. I’m a 36A and I wear a Large bottom normally (size 10). I bought the small top and the large bottom and they fit just fine. The adjustable ties also work great for personalizing the size. Would definitely purchase from this shop again in the future.
5907,Amazing bikini set. The quality was awesome. I am so excited to wear this on my vacation! Shipping was prompt and professional. I most definitely will be ordering from this shop again.
5908,best bikinis ever! and fast shipping.
5909,"So first and foremost, customer service is excellent. Through no fault of the shop, I did not receive my swimsuit. USPS lost it. I contacted the seller and was immediately responded to. She told me she would refund me but I requested a new one, which she sent immediately. The bottoms are amazing. The quality is fantastic. The whole suit is very flattering especially the color. Highly recommend!"
5910,Received this really fast and the quality is excellent!  Love it!
5911,Hands down my favorite bikini I own! So flattering and super fast shipping!
5912,"I am ABSOLUTELY in love with this swimsuit! Very cute, figure flattering, and it fits perfectly. I will definitely order again soon :)"
5913,"Love the quality of this suit. Got it to be twinsies with my daughter.
Shipped very fast."
5914,My swimsuit is so adorable!  High quality and looks amazing.  Got it sooner than expected as well.  Thanks so much!
5915,"Normally, I'm a medium but I bought this in XL for a maternity swimsuit.  I love the suit.  It's a little tight but I'm hoping that I can still fit in it for the last month of pregnancy."
5916,"Well made, cute 50's look."
5917,"I have bought this same swimwear before years ago and loved it, and when the next one arrived it wasn't quite the same but still lovely."
5918,"So cute, exactly like the picture.  Can't wait to wear it. Excellent customer service."
5919,"Well made, seller worked with our time schedule to get it to us ahead of time"
5920,"The suit itself was very cute. I wish it had actually fit me. I gave the contact person my measurements, noting my concern about the size not actually fitting my body. I was assured it would fit, so I purchased the suit. Lo and behold, it didn't fit. I was told I could return it for another size, but that they wouldn't be able to get it to me in time for the holiday weekend (another concern I had brought up earlier). I decided to just give it to my sister instead of returning it, paying more to have it be my size, and still not getting to wear it for the weekend. When my sister put it on, some of the stitching snapped. The padding in the bra was barely worth it. For the size of the top, the padding just covered the nipples and didn't provide any shapping, except that you could see the outline of the padding which was tacky."
5921,"Buyer beware -- this style of the swimsuits are no longer made in the US unless you ask for it specifically. I received a very poorly-made suit with a tag saying ""made in China"" initially. The pads were literally tacked onto the suit instead of being sewn into the lining (the pads are also not actual pads, just very thin lining material that should be standard on any swimsuit). Upon contacting the owner, she responded immediately and told me she'd moved the manufacture of this style to China after expanding, but would send me the same suit from a California manufacturer. The CA-made suit was much higher quality and fit great. Just definitely ask ahead about which suits are made in which location."
5922,bought over handfuls of bikinis and never dissapointed! I've done many custom pieces and Jennifer is so easy and awesome to work with. I keep coming back for more! Great fit and quality!
5923,"Another amazing perfect Bikini, that fits me perfect!"
5924,Thank you!!! Fits perfect 👌
5925,"This suit fits me perfectly, and looks amazing. Great craftsmanship and service."
5926,Her work is always amazing. I have two suits. I hope she comes back to making them again one day.
5927,"I am officially OBSESSED, I have never owned such a flattering cut one-piece....so I had to buy one in every color!"
5928,Best swimsuit I have ever had. Fits me beautifully and incredibly flattering even though I have a larger body size.
5929,The only problem with my order was that I received a wrong color (plain instead of dotted blue). The swimsuit is still gorgeous (and the taxing was quite a pain) so I decided to keep it.
5930,"Ultra sexy bikini, I love it"
5931,My Wife loves it ! So sexy..
5932,"Amazing fit, excellent quality and fast delivery. Looks so good on, would have posted a photo if it wasn't I pic of me in a swimming costume"
5933,"Amazing, better than I expected, I love it! There was a slight concern with shipping but it didn't take long to arrive regardless"
5934,"@@@ Love Badinka! Delighted with my purchase on EVERY level - Very Responsive Customer Care  - Fairly priced - Delivered promptly - 5 STAR!
'Women's Swimwear 
Would a 57 young at heart MALE hardcore clubber wear THIS? Yes! Wonder if I am the first male to purchase and wear this design? 
I often will seek 'OUT' designs designated for the ladies - for me the 'gender' of clothing is of NO consequence - I love mixing everything masculine & feminine.
The principle of the clothing I always select is as follows:
1) Prefer to be low key.
2) Prefer not to stand 'OUT' in a crowd.
3) Prefer not to draw attention to myself
Does not seem to be working! He he!

5935,"Super cute, fit well & arrived on time. Only issue is the stitching is a bit sloppy."
5936,Sensational piece. Summer is going to be spectacular. X
5937,"Took a long time to ship.  The heart print is pixelated, which is fun, but the pixels are too large for the size of the heart, so the heart loses impact as a 3 dimensional image, whereas the skeleton is full-on 3D."
5938,Amazing! One or two loose threads I had to cut off but other than that great quality. And it shipped so quickly which I was not expecting in the middle of a pandemic. Thank you so much!
5939,I love the shorts and the sizes is perfect ❤️
5940,I really like this bathing suit. It runs a little small but is adjustable with the straps if you are willing to take the time to adjust them (there are a lot of straps in this bathing suit). My favorite part is the sturdy part in the front. The green is a good color.
5941,"Such a cute swimsuit! It holds on pretty well(will have to come back to let ya know if it is in water) and I love how comfortable it is! The shipping was so fast, didn't even wait a week after ordering before I got it"
5942,"Loving this new piece!
Quite a cute and unique fit!"
5943,"better quality than expected 
Shipped fast"
5944,I loved the swimsuit and very sexy.
5945,So cute but def on the small size.- especially in the boob area
5946,Ordered this outfit because I love how the white sheen made me think of pearl. It’s a beautiful outfit and I love how it looks on me. Only complaint is the neckties were shorter than I’d like
5947,"perfect fit, great material, glows bright"
5948,"A teeny tiny on the small side, but I love it and the print is gorgeous! Padding is perfect and I felt just sexy on my wedding weekend! Thank you so much!"
5949,Loved my bathing suit for my bachelorette weekend! I was worried it wouldn’t get here in time but the seller responded to all my questions quickly and made sure I received my bathing suit on time!
5950,"Ordered a pink bathing suit for my upcoming wedding. Super cute, can’t wait to wear these in Mexico with the girls"
5951,"Such a good material, and looked like it was going to be so flattering (and not see through, thank goodness) for the bride!"
5952,So cute! Came in great time! Just a bit short after ordering a size up but I can stretch it! Thank you!
5953,TotallyBrides helped us to get some replacement bathing suits in time for my daughter's bachelorette party!  They made us four bathing suits to match some suits that the girls already purchased elsewhere but did not fit.  They made the bathing suits and shipped them extremely quick and we received them in time for the party.  And the bathing suits were beautifuly and great quality!!! They did run small but we assumed that and ordered the perfect sizes!!
5954,💜
5955,"Exactly what I envisioned! I'm 5'5"" and 165lbs and the XL fits well, but the straps are a little long. Definitely could have went with a Large."
5956,"Very nice quality swim suit, fits wonderfully, and looks great! There was an issue with shipping due to Covid-19 but the seller was very quick to respond and sent another bathing suit right away. It came quickly after that and I am highly satisfied."
5957,"Love it, it’s fits perfect"
5958,"Absolutely beautiful and feels good quality. Shipping took over a month unfortunately, but not completely shops fault. I ordered a medium, but it’s way too small. Definitely size up!! I am almost 5’7” and 149lbs for reference. Shop had good customer service and got back to me quick with all my questions. Sadly I didn’t read that bathing suits could not be exchanged or returned."
5959,Great swimsuit!!!
5960,I bought one in white and one in black! I loved them both but the white one was a bit see through when wet.
5961,"I am IN LOVE with this suit, great quality and print. So fun and cannot wait to wear!"
5962,"Very good quality , amazing print"
5963,"SUPER ADORABLE! The seller was very helpful in finding the right font and color and it was shipped making sure the writing wasn't wrinkled. My sister in law LOVES it with the coordinating hat for her honeymoon, but did say the fit is a bit small - not so much that she wants to size up but did say it's ""definitely a sexy cut!"""
5964,Super cute and great fit! Will definitely use this business again!
5965,"A little on the smaller size, but super cute"
5966,I can’t wait to wear this for my bachelorette party! Exactly what I was looking for! There isn’t really any support or cups on the top of this. So if you have a concern with that you may want to be cautious when buying this item. But even without that it seems like it will work for me!
5967,Cute swim suit but totally see thru and runs small.
5968,Quality seems good. Fits pretty much as expected. Wish the top had padding but it’s not a deal breaker.
5969,Good quality and fast processing time. Thank you!
5970,Took along time to shop & get delivered
5971,"Horrible I ordered July.22 for me and my daughter it was suppose to be here by 8/6 just in time for my sister’s bachelorette weekend all the bridesmaids wore one over the weekend, except me and my daughter and I’m the MOH, you can never get a response from the seller, I still didn’t receive my order, and she will probably delete this review. She said everything is backed up she should of said that from the start I would of overnighted it and paid. I’ve ordered things and received them on time in the past 2 weeks that’s a poor excuse. It said the package was being shipped on July.29th and it’s Aug.12th and I still didn’t receive my order. Don’t waste your time or money ordering from her, and now after reading her reviews I’m not the only one this happened too."
5972,"Very hard to get in contact with when item was not shipped on time. I basically had to harass them to send my stuff. Their shipping policy states 1-2 weeks and after 2.5 weeks without my item shipped yet I began emailing to no response.  My Bachelorette party was coming up and I still didn’t have my 
item and it had been 3 weeks.  They need to change their shipping info if they aren’t going  to send stuff in the time told on the shipping info.  The writing on the swimsuit was poorly put on and the swimsuit is cheaply made. A joke of a company."
5973,Bathing suit is amazing quality and so so cute. It did take a little over 3 months to arrive but totally worth the money and the wait!! In love 😍😍
5974,"I absolutely LOVE this bikini. The vender herself
is a sweetheart. I had so many alterations and she accommodated for every single one. I would buy 12 of these if I could. It's so durable, so beautiful, and fits so well. Best purchase I've made in a long time and hands down my favorite bathing suit ❤️"
5975,The Bikini fits perfectly and it looks amazing!! Thank you so much!
5976,Gorgeous! Amazing handy work. Can’t wait to wear this on the beach. The Brazilian cut bottom is so sexy
5977,Perfect item! Seller goes above and beyond to help! this is the third bikini purchased. Amazing quality!
5978,"Great quality, thank you!!"
5979,"Perfect everything, I Love it,
The wonderfull quality of the fabric,
Is flatters my body
Biggest Thanks"
5980,"I was nervous to order this swimsuit, but I can assure you, IT IS STUNNING. I have never loved a swimsuit like this one. It has such style and a gorgeous fit."
5981,Fits so well I would order other suits from here again
5982,Beautiful! I get to wear these designs on the beach!
5983,Top notch. I love this shop and the product quality is great most of the time.
5984,"Great bikini bottom, i cannot wait to wear it on vacation this winter when i got to florida.  I love flashyouandme products, all well made, great fit, very friendly and helpful.  I am a repeat customer."
5985,Put this item back online upon my request and it fits perfectly. Love it. Thanks
5986,This is a completely gorgeous sports bra designed and customized to your measurements for the perfect fit--no slipping or rubbing or accidental peekaboo.  Wonderful!
5987,Beautiful colors! Perfect fit. Will definitely purchase from this hope again.
5988,"Great product! perfectly made, fast shipping and friendly service!! thank you so much!"
5989,"I love this matching swimsuit set!  Having never purchased a swimsuit online, I was a little anxious about the sizing.  I am 5'9"" (140 lbs) and generally wear small or medium.  Using the vendor's size chart, I decided to purchase the small top and bottoms.  They fit me very well.  I presume the medium size would probably provide a little more coverage.  I highly recommend this vendor.  Shipping was fast and effective."
5990,"This swim suit is VERY flattering and fit perfectly. For reference, I am 5'9"" 120 lbs and ordered an XS top and bottom. I was impressed with the high quality and unique look and I was so impressed, I even ordered another in red!"
5991,Shipped on time. Fit well.
5992,The turquoise mesh that was added was such a lovely surprise!!!! I had wanted that for my stitching option but didn't know about mesh colors too! It is so amazing. Best swim/dance bottoms ever.
5993,"Super comfy and nice, simple design. The mesh part on the waist hides possible love handles ""overflow"" well!"
5994,Look exactly as pictured and they fit. I really like the length!!!
5995,"Thank you! They're fantastic. Most comfortable, flattering, and non-binary suit I've ever owned. I'll be buying you're whole shop as I settle into this new job. Thanks so much! Enjoy your vacation."
5996,The cut is very flattering and the black mesh add a sexy touch to it ! I love it. A must have for this summer.
5997,Awesome quality! Fits perfectly! Thank you!
5998,"Beautifully made swimming costume, I’m usually a a dress size 6-8 and went for the XS and it fit perfectly. Kerry was so lovely and helpful would highly recommend... thanks"
5999,Love Bikiniboo swimsuits so much! Always perfect and Kerry is just wonderful. Can’t wait to treat myself again next year! Xx
6000,"This is my third bathing suit from bikiniboo and honestly Kerry is theeee best!!!!! My first suit I ordered several years ago and it still looks brand new! I can’t wait to have a whole collection of these amazing bathing suits. Kerry also writes little personal notes and thank yous, it’s the little things. I would highly recommend ordering from her, you won’t regret it!"
6001,The fabric is so smooth and soft I adore it. The cut is fantastic and gives me that perfect pin up silhouette. I can't wait till the sun comes out! Thanks again.
6002,"Super soft and fits great! Will be back for more! 
(5’10”, 155pounds, DDD cup, large fits great!)"
6003,"So soft! So well fitting! It absolutely perfect! 
Also the shop owner is the nicest, most accommodating person & my favourite part was that the order came with a personalised note!
It was a pleasure to shop here!"
6004,The most comfortable and fabulous swim suit I have ever had. LOVE!! It looks exactly like the pictures online. Shipped quickly and arrived with a sweet handwritten note 🌸
6005,Really cute suit! Soft material too!
6006,So comfortable and sexy :)
6007,Even better than I imagined.  Can't wait to wear it!
6008,"Incredibly well made! This is store-bought quality stuff. So glad to have found this! I absolutely required a high waisted cheeky fit and this was just about my only option, so I’m so glad it turned out to be such high quality."
6009,I love the way these bottoms look! So flattering. They also feel very high-quality and well made.
6010,"These are perfect! Sexy, high waisted bottoms that are well made and a good price. Exactly what I was looking for!"
6011,I ordered a 2x looks more like a L. It also didn’t come “high waist” like advertised.
6012,"Absolutely LOVE the Margo bottoms and matching top! I'm an xs and every bathing suit I ever get xs bottoms are usually too big or they end up being more of a high rise even when I order low rise bottoms and let me tell you these margo bottoms fit SO well, they are actually low rise and make my butt look cute! So happy with my purchase and will only ever order my bathing suits from here now! Thank you!!"
6013,I wear a 34D bra and the large fit me well. Stays on! Love it.
6014,Sporty and cute. Does run a bit small but still love it

6026,I'm extremely happy I found Olga's shop! High quality and a perfect fit! I'll definitely be ordering again! ♥️♥️
6027,Absolutely love these bottoms
6028,Very Stylish Great Fit!! Very Comfortable!!
6029,"I have not received my item yet in order to take a picture, however I did purchase from this seller and when the item came in it wasn't exactly what I expected. She surpassed my expectations she was amazing with her customer service, and reached out to me in order to fix the situation. Jennifer sent out my new order in a very fast and timely manner. She was very diligent in making me happy, and that is great customer service! I would recommend this seller to anyone!"
6030,"great fabric, fits perfectly on me sizing is true to size"

6032,Awesome! Great product and shipping
6033,"Hands down one of the most flattering bathing suits I've ever purchased. Great quality and the seller was very responsive. Im a short girl with thick thighs and a bum, this fit like a glove. I normally wear a MD but needed a large in this suit bc of it. Will definitely purchase from this shop again in the future."
6034,"Fits perfectly and it’s very flattering! My package came a little late but Bonny was very nice and accommodating and even sent me a free bikini for the late shipment! :) 
Love it!"
6035,Amazing customer service.  My mono kini was well made and fits great!
6036,"Very good quality, jus wish the boob part a little more better...."

6038,"Olivia is so sweet and helpful! Very quick with responses and very professional. Shipping was fast, and this bikini top is SO freakin cute and well made!! I’m obsessed. Happy I purchased from her ❤️"
6039,Perfect for my Christina Aguilera costume!! Got a medium and I’m a 34D and fit perfectly! Good quality.
6040,I purchased this top for my Halloween costume & it couldn’t be more perfect! The shop owner was super helpful with me figuring out what size would be best - even after I submitted my order & it fit perfectly thanks to her advice! Great quality & honestly I’ll probably use it as a bathing suit top come next summer too! ☺️
6041,Love. The owner communicated very well with me. We talked back and forth about what sizing would be best for me. I am so thankful we went with the XS padded. Thank you again.
6042,Fits perfect. I ordered an XL and i have 34dd chest

6048,Il est super beau et de très bonne qualité ! merci 😊
6049,Exactly as described. Great fit too!
6050,Messaged the shop upon purchasing the Xtina top with a shipping address change. It still got sent to the wrong address even though the shop owner confirmed the change and my Halloween costume was incomplete :( Wish the owner offered to overnight the top with free shipping so I could stilll wear the costume I had planned.. Got a full refund instead but left feeling disappointed as communicating with a small shop shouldn’t leave much room for miscommunication. Oh well :/
6051,Arrived very quickly and great quality!
6052,SOOOOO CUTE! Great quality too. Shipped very quickly.
6053,Amazing item! Well made   with quality fabric. Extremely fast shipping. I can't wait to wear on my honeymoon! Thank you!
6054,I love this top. Sexy yet modest. If you have large breasts order a large. I usually wear small in shirts but in this top ordered a large and it was perfect (34DD).
6055,Looks great on and didn't take long to ship.
6056,"Quick shipping, fits as expected."
6057,It shipped on time and was the right thing
6058,"This/These bathing suits are adorable! They are well made and fit nicely. My daughter loved the special details and obvious and time and energy put into these beauties. The customer experience was fabulous and this seller cares about her customers! Thank you BuenaOndaBikini, we can't wait to hit the pool!"
6059,My daughter loves this bathing suit! Super awesome and very friendly costumer service!! Thank you so much😘
6060,"I loved it!! Would definitely recommend and is great quality. I got a lot of compliments and it looks exactly like the kiini bathing suits, you can tell the difference!"
6061,Wow! Love it! A gift for my daughter and she was very happy! Very well made and fit perfect.  Took longer than expected because of Covid 19 ( which was fine) but seller was very kind & sent an extra suit to compensate! Thanks so much! Highly recommend!! 🤗
6062,WOW! They were SO responsive when I had questions about this product and it is SO SO well made! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!
6063,This suit is beautiful! So well made and especially because it’s handmade it’s amazing. Going to the Bahamas in April and cannot wait to wear it there! 10/10 recommend!
6064,The seller was so kind and she really stands by her work! The suit quality is also amazing!!!
6065,"Fantastic quality, a beautiful suit!"
6066,Beautiful and high quality! My daughter loves it! Going to order another for my other daughter :)
6067,Great shop and seller very kind and replies fast!!
6068,Decided to return these. The quality wasn't great and it arrived late.
6069,"Really nice, took a while though."
6070,"Super soft, lightweight, none of the harsh swimsuit lines that are typical with elastic suits. 
Very comfortable, I can wear the top just around the house. 
Though says hand wash, mine got washed (accidentally) in washing machine and turned out just fine!
Love my suit:) fave by far that I’ve owned. Lots of compliments on the style too.
Thank you GOAMAGIC!"
6071,I love this suit! I bought it for my girlfriend for her birthday. She absolutely loves it but was a little self conscious at 1st because it’s super sexy. She wasn’t willing to wear it at the beach until I came with her. Which of course I was happy to do. The material is incredibly soft. Almost velvety silk or something. The color is gorgeous and goes great with my ladie’s green eyes. It looks hand dyed. I’m very happy with this suit. It’s of very high quality. And the fact that it’s handmade makes it the only suit in our area like it :) thank you
6072,The most flattering swimsuit I've ever purchased! The quality and craftmanship is clear and I LOVE the color and fit. I get compliments all the time - Thank you <3
6073,"Good quality of the fabric/lycra.
Didn't like that it doesn't have the finish/fold, its clear cut. Works fine on the top but not on the bottom part/boxer. Doesn't fit so well and it curls so you can see the stichting. For the price that was a bit disappointing.
Overall is very pretty."
6074,Bathing suit is really cute but the bottoms are not high wasted. They also run very small for a M... contacted seller to exchange for a L and was made to seem like it will be way more trouble than it is worth. Disappointed as I’ll squeeze into it but would love the bathing suit so much more for an easy size exchange
6075,Shipped on time and fits amazing!! The fabric is so nice and thick I love it
6076,Perfect.  Love it!  Thank you!
6077,This is the most perfect suit! I absolutely love it ❤️
6078,Perfect fit great quality. Will order from Bleorden again!
6079,Thank you so much I love it
6080,"Fab product. Well made, great fit. Love it"
6081,"THE PERFECT SWIM SUIT!!!!
ni wore this for the first time today... in hawaii!
ni swam in the warm beautiful hawaiian ocean wearing this,
nthen wrapped a sarong around my waist & shopped the local farmers market sipping a fresh coconut : )
nso cute, so comfy, so flattering.
ni love everything about it ~ especially that it is handmade!
nthe construction is exceptional, the fit is amazing.
njen is a sweetheart, and sent this express to make sure i had it in time for my vacation.
nthank you, jen!"
6082,"these are super cute! I love the tangerine fabric and all the different colored panels. these are well made and professionally done. the fit is cute and flattering and comfortable. in the picture on the listing the back side appears to be fuchsia and mine came in army green, so I guess I should have specified the back side color, but I am still really happy with these! the waist band is a little loose so consider giving that measurement a little smaller than what it is. overall I really like them! also note that her turnaround time can really be up to 10 weeks - which it says clearly in her policy. just plan ahead! Jen was really nice and helpful and always answered my questions in a timely manner. thanks!"
6083,Cooler than I could have imagined! Can't wait to rock them at the beach! I heart jmorco!
6084,I am ABSOLUTELY in love with this piece that Jen has created!!! The top and bottom fit perfectly and I could not be happier. Really looking forward to rockin' this on the beaches in summer and in my yoga classes!!! Thank you so much Jen!!!!!
6085,"got my suit today!!! absolutely FANTASTIC! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! and arrived just in time for my vacation! YAY!!! they took almost 3 months, but the quality is outstanding and well worth the wait!!! BEST SWIMSUIT EVER! Jen is the best!
nthank you so much!"
6086,"Jen has amazing customer service skills and really worked to get me my package, considering the postal strike and missing and returned parcels.  I could not be happier with the quality of these shorts, and these are my first bathing suit bottoms ever that I don't feel the need to wear shorts over top. The patterns, colours and especially the ruched butt make these shorts really unique and fabulous.  Thank you Jen and I feel that I will be back soon!"
6087,Sooooo adorable!  The cut is super flattering and it fits like it was made for me :))  I'm crazy about this bikini set!!  Thank you!
6088,"Amazing! Jen made sure I got these in time for my vacay, I can't wait to wear them! They fit perfect, great quality materials, colors are vibrant and fun.  Love the details of the functional drawstring, and cute key ring tab. Couldn't be happier!"
6089,Amazing shorts! I feel so confident and beautiful wearing these! I highly recommend giving Jen your measurements because I am digging this custom fit. Absolutely worth the price and the wait. Thank you so much!!
6090,"Another amazing piece from jmorco (4th purchase from this store).

6092,These are the most amazing swim/exercise shorts! I gave Jen my measurements and they fit perfectly. Quality craftsmanship as well! Jen was flexible and super nice in conversation and answering questions. I'll definitely be a repeat customer. Thank you!

6116,Looks amazing on my bride squad team!
6117,great gift! letters look just as pictured and good quality suit!
6118,"Although, the team was great with customizing my drip squad birthday swimsuits, the colors were completely off and the designs were peeling off upon receipt. They did offer a 15% off discount for my inconvenience, however I will not recommend using them again as I was not satisfied with my purchase. Especially, with purchasing a bulk."
6119,"Responsive service, item received as expected."
6120,Fit great its a great piece the wife looks great in it will buy from seller again!
6121,This is even better than I expected it to be!

6124,"Love this top and bottom! Such amazing quality and beautifully made. Will be buying more from this store :)

I’m a small B, so seeing what a size C looked like on the other photos I decided a B would fit me perfect, in love!"
6125,"I love the way this turned out, finally something that holds my girls in! It is stunning. I was a little worried about how the straps would look on my natural boobs but everything looks beautiful."
6126,"This has become my very favorite shop! Each piece is durably hand made and well worth the small wait and definitely beyond worth the price! 
The fit is amazing! I wear a 36D bra, but I specified C because I prefer a bit more skin showing. This piece is loaded with sparkle!"
6127,I love it!!! it's precious and I'll be getting more soon! Thank you
6128,"This suit arrived just in time for my vacation to Spain and I couldn't be happier with it! The green color is very flattering, and I love that the top has a lot of coverage. The bottoms fit like a glove. Thank you Eynat for helping me get the right sizes in both!"
6129,"Beautiful ! I am so happy I finally bought this bikini. I was a bit afraid the fabric would be flimsy, but not at all - it is sturdy, good quality and the cut is very flattering. Eynat give a really good service. She contacted me prior to processing my order to make sure I was ordering the correct size."
6130,"Loooove my suit! The fit is perfect, it’s well made, and good quality fabric. Thank you!!"
6131,Beautiful fabric and fit. The seller communicated well and made this transaction a lovely experience.
6132,This was perfect!!! Thank you so much for adding just a little extra fabric to cover up a scar. I can not tell you how much I love this! Wll be making another purchase in the future!
6133,Amazing fit.  I've looked so long for someone to make bikinis to fit me. I love it! Thank you so much.
6134,The bathing suit is great! It looks so good on and the material is a great quality. She even sewed in extra liners and pockets for my own inserts!
6135,The Coolest Bathing Suit EVER!!!!!
6136,I love this swimsuit! It fits so well and is very comfortable while also very sexy! The scrunchbutt is perfect! The design well made. The designer’s customer service is great!

6144,"Super bikini, good quality, fast delivery. I love it!"

6146,"Great product, arrived in a timely manner."
6147,This is my second time purchasing from bunni and i really have no complaints!💝 The cardigan is light and the colors are vibrant. It makes me feel cool in a way knowing i can sport my nerdiness just a little bit. Thanks again bunni you are the best!! :) 💕
6148,Amazing! Really good quality... I love it! Worth the wait due to covid 19. Thank you!
6149,Bought this for a friend and she loves it! Perfect gift as it's purple (fav. color) and the Last Unicorn (fav. fandom).

6151,"OMG I love this and so happy.  Obviously designed by someone who actually wears them as well!  💃💃💃
Thank you so much 😊"
6152,"Absolutely Beautiful!

☺"
6153,"Absolutely Beautiful!

My Fiancée will love it!!

Thank you for the extra item!

☺"
6154,Toller Bikini. Danke
6155,"The photo does not tell the truth, it is better! love it! Thanks you a lot."
6156,"Love these so much, I got an extra small I’m 5’1 125lbs they do fit a Lil big around my waist but other than that they made my butt look amazing"
6157,I asked for the top to have a band instead of the fold over because I wanted it to stay in place. I wear a 16/18 but have a lower belly pouch. This covers all of that. Very well made! Bought size 3X. I’m 5’10.
6158,I just received the bikini bottom and tried it on. IT FITS PERFECTLY!!! It hides what I want it to hide (mommy pouch) and accentuates what I want to show off (booty in progress). I am so excited to hit the beach! I love it so much I can cry! Will post a picture after I get to flaunt it at the beach. ♥️
6159,These bottoms are AWESOME!!!!!! The quality and craftsmanship of each pair is top notch!! Just order them and never think twice about it!! I wear a size 14/16 and ordered these in a size XXL.... They fit great! Here is a picture of the front coverage. I have left other reviews here that show the back side! :) Love love love these bottoms!!
6160,I absolutely LOVE these bathing suit bottoms!  They fit perfectly and are sooo cute.  I am a big-booty girl and they still fit perfectly according to the size chart.
6161,Great quality and looks great!!  So glad I found Sunnyside Swimwear!
6162,"This bottom fits amazingly!!! I ordered 1 at first, and after it was delivered I immediately ordered 2 more! Don't hesitate if you are a thicker female but wanna show off that back side!! Just click the buy it now button!! :) :) I have attached pictures of me in the black XXL bottom. I am a size 14/16. Hope this helps anyone potentially looking to purchase this item!!"
6163,"Love this!  The high waist gave my wife the confidence to wear a two-piece, but the cut in back keeps it from looking like bloomers the way so many high-waisted bottoms do.  The fold over band gives lots of control over coverage while the cheeky back highlights her best asset!  Definitely recommended to ladies who want to show off a little, but don't necessarily want to show off a mommy tummy.  Her newfound confidence is the sexiest part. Processing and shipping were quick. Happy buyer here!"
6164,UHM the beach is not ready for my tanned body in this red thong bikini. This is my favorite fitting swimsuit I’ve had in YEARS . I have a stubborn apron belly after having a big ol baby and this is extremely slimming and sexy as hell. Will be back for sure ! This seller knows women’s body’s ! Thank you x 10000
6165,The perfect bikini bottom for a tropical vacation. Bought three colors and I can't wait to get more!!
6166,Couldn't be any happier! Order these ASAP!! :) :) I ordered them in size XXL and I wear a size 14/16 and they fit GREAT!!
6167,"Very nice material, stretchy and thick, fit so perfect and looks great! Amazing quality."
6168,It’s perfect! And shipped pretty quickly. I’m super happy with this purchase. Thanks!
6169,I've been looking for something like this for awhile and so happy I finally found it with quality material and a seller that's super responsive. Quick delivery. Very happy!
6170,THank you for fixing my bottoms and making them custom for me!!!
6171,Very cute on! Gives nice shape. Was so thankful to find a bigger size abs still have it be cute and sexy!
6172,Perfect for our vacation to Mexico! 🍑
6173,"Fits perfectly, and is very comfortable! Also arrived early! Fantastic!"
6174,Love my bottoms! Can’t wait for my cruise to wear it!!
6175,Super cute fun and sexy!!! Wore it to the beach with my man for vacation he loved it!
6176,"fantastic look, wear size 12-14 bottom, xl was a perfect fit. No really my usual bikini bottom but the large band (and foldable) make it look fantastic not too undressed.Seller very helpful, thanks"
6177,"Pictured here is this bottom in black but I as the husband Love the fit, hugs tight around the waist and makes the booty really pop.  Definitely an eye catcher around the pool, as I have noticed. Would recommend this item especially for those women who have a great booty but lack the confidence to show it off because of a tummy issue.  The fold over waist band when not folded acts like a tummy shaper if not folded over.  Awesome design which gives me the eye candy I want with my wife in a thong but gives her the confidence to show it off while being comfortable in a 2 piece bikini 👙 😀"

6180,True to size and great fit for a fuller figure.
6181,"Well made product and the seller made it easy to exchange for a smaller size when I ordered the wrong size. Fast shipping, easy exchange and good communication. Items are made true to size. I would definitely purchase from this shop again."
6182,"I am a size 14 in pants and got the XXL thong bottoms. They fit perfectly. not too tight on the thong. like them so much bought a second pair in another color. very high quality fabric and stitch work. will definately look to buy other suits from here. 
let's talk shipping!! wow super fast.  got it 3 days earlier than promised. shipped out right away."
6183,My new favorite swim bottoms !!!
6184,Love these! Fit just like I hoped they would!
6185,"These bottoms are fantastic, made really well and fit great. I'm a fan!"
6186,Great fit. Soft and just enough stretch. Super comfy! Want in other colors!
6187,"This seller really came through. I needed this product for an event on 06/27, I purchased the product and express mailing on 06/17. Concerned about the arrival of the package, I messaged the seller and they quickly responded saying that they would get the package right out to me. IT SHOWED UP WAY EARLY! I appreciate the seller making haste. The product is true to size and fits well. The product is made well."
6188,"I am a size 14 so I ordered the XXL. I was very glad I did. With thongs, I am always conservative and order larger to make sure the thong is not too tight.  Great craftsmanship.  Shipping was very fast. The shop had it in the mail the next day.  Actually arrived 3 days early than quoted."

6191,This is our second order and happy again. fast shipping is a plus.

6205,"Excellent 
😻😻😻"
6206,"Great quality- looks just like the picture. I’m 5’4, 120lbs and it’s very snug on me. If you’re any bigger I would contact the seller with your measurements. Jessica has great communication!"
6207,Love it!! Love it in black
6208,Love it so cute fits perfect
6209,this was nice but was made for someone with a much shorter torso. sold it to a coworker for $20 :[
6210,"Delivery took way too long - a month. I knew the item is one size, I usually wear M, and this is really small have to say. Very disappointed. Won’t order again. Wasn’t worth of waiting."
6211,so beautiful! i'm very happy with my purchase! thank youuu
6212,"It was great, and fit perfectly. I could've delt without the stuff that smelled inside of the package but overall it's great quality and looked amazing on."
6213,Shipped quickly. But the stuff in the bag made it smell horrible. Other than that it's awesome.
6214,"Hice que mi esposa vestir este bikini en la playa. Muchos hombres comenzaron a mirarla. Yo era sentada junto con ella en la arena de la playa, y los hombres no podían controlar sus ojos mirando las chichis voluptuosos de mi esposa. Un hombre tuvo el coraje de pedirla que la comprarle una bebida delante de mí. Yo la permité. Ella fue con el hombre al bar. Después de tomar unas copas con el hombre, el hombre comenze a acariciar las chichis de mi esposa debajo de este bikini. Ellos fueron a cuarto de hotel de el y regresó tarde. Ella me dijo que dejó su bikini en la cuarto del hotel del hombre. Así que tuve que comprarle otro. No puedo esperar para hacer esto otra vez. Me encanta que me pongan los cuernos."
6215,"This top is amazing! I asked to have it double lined, and my request was done perfectly! It was super cute and even provided decent support (I'm someone that needs it!)! Thanks so much!"
6216,Its so pretty I love it!! The seller is also really nice and answer's questions super fast!! I got it the day before Cinco de Mayo so I was really happy about that. I'll definitely be back for other items everything is so beautiful!!!
6217,"I love this bikini, it is very well made and fits perfectly! I was aware of the few weeks it would take for it to get here,the shipper was great about getting it to me by the day I needed it! Thanks so much!"
6218,i love it!  My wife wears this and she is absolutely stunning!  She gets many looks from guys and it drives me crazy jealous!
6219,"Would NOT recommend buying from this shop at all! Bought 2 items and both were not as pictured. If I could give it 0 stars I would! Overpriced, Shipping took 2 months, & item is not as pictured at all! The fabric is different, the colors are different , and the flag isn’t even evenly centered."
6220,Love this bathing suit!  Looks even better in person.
6221,"I totally love it, it fits great!!!"
6222,Really good quality and great customer service!
6223,"I couldn't be happier with my purchase! The swimsuit is a perfect fit, the quality of it is exceptional and the colours are ever so vibrant!
Kerry was amazing communication-wise, she was very nice and patient in her answers to my numerous questions!
I honestly can't recommend her shop enough! If you are looking for the perfect swimsuit for the upcoming summer, you are at the right place!"
6224,"Love! Oh my gosh I love it! It will truly look great no matter your body shape, no joke. I am slender, 5'10"" so I went for the added length that they offer and I'm glad I did, I have a long torso. It covers my booty so I dont feel like I'm showing the goods off to everyone on the beach. I'm so excited to rock it this summer!"
6225,"Love my bikini boo, fits well and beautifully made!! Thanks so much xx"
6226,Love love love! It fits me so cute! I absolutely love the print! Thanks!
6227,"I have a long torso, so the tall size was AWESOME! This is a comfy swim suit that fits great and has a cool print! My friends commented that the deep V in the front and the open back make it super posh and sexy. I’m ready to buy a second one!"
6228,"This is a lovely swim suit, thank you very much!"
6229,This is such a pretty one piece
6230,It is gorgeous! BUY IT!
6231,Prompt shipment and beautiful swimsuit!! Already planning my second purchase ;)
6232,Well made and great quality!
6233,"Fit as expected and is super cute, arrived on time. Im 5’1, 130lbs and a B cup and I ordered a small."
6234,I’m literally in LOVE with this bikini top. The fact that I’ve never gotten a white bikini before this moment is a crime against humanity and I’m so glad it could be this one. I’m a 34C and the medium fits like a dream!
6235,Very comfortable top! My cup size is 36b and usually I fit size L tops so I got L size for this but I could have definitely sized down. Isn't an issue though as the top still fits well!
6236,So. Cute. And great quality too. I’m a 32B/0/24 and the small top and bottom fits perfectly 🤍 thank you!
6237,I LOVE IT! it fits perfectly and such good quality!
6238,Loved it! Super cute on!
6239,Really comfy bikini top and fits perfectly 🥰
6240,Cute and sexy top. Would love to order in all black.
6241,"I paid to have it shipped next day, but it took 8 days for it to be sent out. I tried contacting the shop owner twice about the shipping, but she never responded. I was disappointed because I wanted it before I went on a vacation and that is why I paid extra for shipping. The suit fits well and is very cute though."
6242,"Fast shipping, great price, comfortable material, awesome!"
6243,"YAAAAAASSSSS words can not describe how thankful I am for ordering this bathing suit. I ordered another right after I tried this one on. The owner is basically my new bff!! Not just because her suits are the most amazing thing I've tried on but because she is so sweet and so helpful. She has gone over and beyond for me in all my special request. Best costumer service I have ever had in my entire my life. If your on the fence about ordering this just do it. You won't regret. Material allows to fit all body shapes. It's sexy and classy. I could go on and on. I ordered a medium, I'm 5'6 weigh 130 and where size 4 in pants with a 36C . Material is stretchy enough my friend who is a size 8-10 And weighs 155 fit perfect in it also."
6244,"I AM IN LOVE!  this suit fits perfectly, it's sexy + beautiful, really well made [lined!!] + dries super quickly.  i will definitely be ordering more!  THANK YOU!!!  :)"
6245,"I LOVE this swimsuit. I have a bigger chest (E cup, 32) and it fits like a dream. If I could I would order this style in every colour and pattern! 
Kerry is a dream shop owner as she communicates quickly and has careful attention to orders :)"
6246,My daughter loved it so much that she took it from me! I need to order another one in a different color! The suits are beautiful!
6247,"Amazing swimsuit, material feels great, fits good and looks and makes me feel fabulous. Will definitely be ordering another one."
6248,I am in love with this swim suit! The fabric is so soft and it fits excellent! Highly recommended as it is gorgeous! I also received excellent customer service. Thank you very much!
6249,It's very beautiful and it fits perfectly!!! Thank you!!!
6250,"Fits perfectly, shipped on time, and I loved the simple but pretty scraps of ribbon it was tied up in! thumbs way up."
6251,"I love it! Fits perfectly, wonderful quality. Thank you so so much. I will definitely be back :)"
6252,Love the top !!! Thank you so much!
6253,Didn't totally fit but I got it fixed at a tailor. Cute
6254,Love it!!!! I didn't except to love it so much. So comfy and cute!
6255,I LOVE IT SO MUCH 10/10. I usually hate shopping for swimwear but this style is perfect and I love it.
6256,"Moriah is a sewing god! Trust her with your money. She is true to her shipping times, I have never had anything come late. She typically can't ship things faster (i.e. if you have a date you need an outfit by) but she most definitely tries her hardest to.

She is one of the only seamstresses I buy from who make clothing from your EXACT meausurements and does it accurately (and I buy a LOT of clothes off of Etsy). I am very tiny so this means everything to me - to receive things that actually fit.

I whined to here because I felt like this shirt was a little too big, but realistically it is true to my measurements, I just prefer clothes to be skin-tight rather than a little baggy. Regardless, she offered to make it a little tighter if I sent it back. 

She also worked with me in allowing me to change the fabric to a stretchy cott"
6257,Extraordinary fit.  I feel so regal.  Looks great as a bodysuit.  I got these with cups which I am grateful that was an option.  I’ve already ordered 2 more in other styles!  Thank you to the designer.
6258,Der schönste Badeanzug ever
6259,"Literally, the most flattering and comfortable swimsuit I've ever worn. I can't wait for the next opportunity to wear it out. This swimsuit incredibly well made."
6260,Great design!
6261,Bought for the bikini for a friend doing a last minute elopement due to COVID wedding cancellation. I needed the bikini made and delivered within 5 days. Reached out to the seller to see if this could be done. They responded promptly and were able to accommodate my request by making and shipping my order that same day. My friend loves it and is one happy bride to be!
6262,I love my swimsuit and it was a great price 💓
6263,Perfect & received quickly! Can't wait to show my fiance on our honeymoon.
6264,I love this pattern! I've made one so far and I'm working on a second. I love the different size and length options. The pattern was easy to follow and it came out as expected!
6265,I absolutely LOVED this pattern. I’m new to crocheting and found the pattern easy to follow. I can’t wait to lay poolside in this coverup.
6266,Turned out beautifully.   I used one color yarn.
6267,"Pattern was very easy to follow, I didn’t change colors my yarn striped by itself.  Love the way it came out!"
6268,Lovely pattern easy to follow
6269,Love the pattern looking forward to making
6270,Immediately available and easy to read!
6271,Ran a little big I thought
6272,"I loved this item! It fits so well, and great coverage!! Came right on time!"
6273,Fast shipping and great product
6274,Fast shipping and great product
6275,This item shipped on time and fits and looks as described. Thank you!
6276,Arrived the day before I left for the festival which did stress me out a bit but Oml when I got it and put it on 🤩🤩 fit me like a glove and complimented me so well. Love ittttt
6277,"My custom bodysuit is beautiful!! Its a little on the smaller side, however, its comfy and extremely well made. Seller was also great with communication and was kind enough to order a specific fabric for me. I will post a picture of it later. Will definitely be a returning customer. Thank you so so much!"
6278,I loved this !! Everyone compliments me all the time on this outfit. I wish you had this exact pattern in different colors I’d buy each one lol it’s my money maker
6279,I love this item so much! Super comfortable and I got so many compliments on it. Thank you so much!
6280,Love it its so cute !
6281,Absolutely love this swimsuit - completely flattering and different to all the ones I saw everyone else wearing on holiday. Shipping was incredibly fast too - will definitely be buying another before my next holiday :)
6282,Such a flattering one piece.  I have a very long torso so I often have a hard time finding one piece bathing suits that fit/look good on me.  Kerry is an absolute delight to deal with!
6283,Was a very beautiful swimsuit and looks very sturdy can't wait to wear it out. Fits true to size as well which is hard to come by at times. Will definitely get another in the future.
6284,"I loved the pattern of this, but It didnt fit me so I send it back. The seller was great about it and returned the money very quickly! Would definately recommend buying from her!"
6285,such pretty patterns!! would order again!
6286,The bottoms fit amazingly! My favorite thing about it is that I can roll it down so I can work on my tan ☺️
6287,I absolutely love my swimsuit! It fits be perfectly. She worked well with me and was very helpful. Would recommend buying a swimsuit. Well worth the money.
6288,Great communication. Seller worked with me to get it here in time for my cruise and I absolutely love this bathing suit! Thank you!
6289,Love it!  Great quality and fit.
6290,This is such a gorgeous suit and the quality is amazing!!! The fit is perfect!!  I'm totally in love!! Thank you!! 😍💖👏
6291,"AMAZING! I absolutely love, love, love everything about my bikini! The fit is perfect and the craftsmanship is beautiful. Definitely recommended and I can't wait to order my next one."
6292,I had a GREAT experience with this amazing artist! I gave her a date and she was able to come through with it and with the most BEAUTIFUL suit I've ever owned! The measuring instructions were detailed where she would know exactly how to make it. I also know she IS the artist and knows her stuff so I gave her some free range to do something different if she thought something else would look better on me. I will for sure be ordering again from her. Thank you
6293,"Shipping takes a long time, as told before purchase. The suit wasn't exactly what i was expecting unfortunately ( the color looked a little off ) Thought i was getting a nude/beige and it was a beigy olive with a little almost shimmer in it.  and the top fit weird. But the craftsmanship is pretty."
6294,Still a masterpiece to add to any swim suit!
6295,I love it! Fits perfectly. Took a little time to get here but since I assume she's making them to order it was still fairly fast.
6296,Thanks again!
6297,le rembourrage est très bien et discret
6298,So so beautiful!  Came from London and still made it in time for Christmas!  It was wrapped so pretty and she even included a free friendship bracelet.  The size was true to size and fit my daughter great.  It can stretch a bit which is great also.  It is definitely even more beautiful in person! My daughter loved it all!
6299,"Bought this bikini for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! Brilliant coloured crocheted cottons offset the white neoprene. Looks fab. The service from Freyja was 1st class, literally. The package arrived 1st class from the UK beautifully wrapped, to the point where I didn’t have to the-wrap it for my daughters birthday. Totally recommend!! Would definitely buy from Freyja again."
6300,"Amazing service and great quality! Considering it came from the UK, it got here faster then some orders here in the US I made WAY prior to ordering this. Absolutely loved the bathing suit and can’t wait to wear it :)"
6301,Freyja was super caring. She recommended me the size and it fits me perfectly. The delivery was fast and the package was lovely. I am really glad with the bikini.
6302,Great buying experience. When my shipping was taking longer than usual she sent me a message with options on my order. Seller is amazingly sweet and truly cares about he costumers. I would definitely buy from her again!
6303,LOVE this bathing suit! Great quality and fit. Would definitely recommend it!!
6304,My daughter is a USA size S on bottom and a size M on top..we went with size S and unfortunately it was veryyyy small. Freya allowed us to exchange it for another size. We chose to size up to a Large seeing how fitted this bikini is. Beautiful quality and Freya is SO NICE to work with.
6305,This vendor is fantastic!!!!  Love the bikini and she has a very old fashioned and personal way of communicating (suit arrived with a handwritten note!) which I absolutely love.
6306,Summer complete with my new bikini 🌞 Love it so much!!

6328,Super cute and very fast shipping!
6329,Very cute. Sizing runs a little small. I asked for measurements before purchasing but they had none available.  My daughter just turned 9 and the 10 barely fits. She is averaged size compared to her classmates.
6330,"Fast shipping, lookin exactly like on photos. Awesome."
6331,Great quality and Fast shipping I will be ordering again!
6332,Good quality and fast shipment!
6333,EVERY other seller worked with me to ensure I received my merchandise for my first born’s First birthday... This seller could care less. Took my money ... No merchandise ... Not willing to even try to suggest Possible resolutions.
6334,First wash and lettering came off very disappointed
6335,This fits amazing! I am a nursing mom with a larger then usual chest right now and have had such a struggle finding a bikini top that doesn't expose too much! I have spent over 100$ on some similar styles but the quality of this one is much better! I'm so happy with my purchase!
6336,"Wonderful....love this bandeau top! Fits perfectly, and appreciated the input on what size to get. I'll be back for more!"
6337,Thank you JoEllen! The measurements that you took from me and the finished product came out perfect! Wow... I am so impressed with the workmanship and the quality of this bikini. I do believe this is the best fitting swimsuit I've ever had! I will definitely be ordering more. The brown color is perfect! The product shipped very quickly and was delivered very quickly! ***** A+
6338,Had to exchange the bra but love the bottoms I received in exchange. Would purchase from this seller again. Excellent customer service!
6339,Fits great and is very well made. Exactly as shown in the photo :)
6340,Perfect! So comfy and exactly what I needed.
6341,Loved it! But unfortunately it didn't fit to sizing I picked :(

6344,My girls LOVED their custom suits!
6345,"Not much comment, hands down. Fast shipping right on time thank you!! Birthday crew was lit!!!"
6346,"I ordered 14 of these and boy the postal system had me so nervous but they arrive right as I was leaving for my daughter's 5th birthday trip. 
They're so cute and durable. They and their parents loved it!"
6347,"Love! Came out so cute and made my baby girl feel special during this weird pandemic time. 

My little one wears a 3T but a 2T would have fit a bit firmer to keep the straps in place. Besides that would absolutely recommend"
6348,The swimsuit is perfect !!!
6349,I have ordered from this vendor more than once and both times the seller was quick in responding. On a recent order I requested changes and there was no hesitation to get my order corrected right away. They only reason I gave 4 starts instead of 5 was the fit of them swimsuit was a little off but satisfied nonetheless!
6350,The letters are already peeling off and looks very cheap. Would not recommend
6351,"Top Artikel, sehr gute Qualität und Verarbeitung. Und ein ganz besonderer, extrem schneller Service und sehr netter individueller Kontakt."
6352,"It's definitely needed for the bikini sets , good quality and the beige color is very neutral.  Fits most of the colors of the swimming suits."
6353,Best shop ever! Shipping didn’t take very long to the states either!
6354,"Great, just as expected. Thank you!!"
6355,"Great communication from seller, item arrived in good time too. 
Love this swimsuit, exactly what I was looking for for the summer/ festival season! 
I was weary of the sizing though, I am 1.67m, curvy and usually a UK size 12/EU 40 (?) and the listing says it should fit up to size 42. That said, it does fit me very well although maybe a little tight in the length, but I think this can be adjusted by loosening the knots on the shoulders. I'm just not sure what the fit would be like for taller girls or girls with even more curves... Not saying it wouldn't fit - I am sure the fabric would also give a little after a few wears - I would just advise caution for those ladies towards size 42/ with longer torsos. But the weaving does make it fit around and hug all the curves, so very flattering overall! Thanks!"
6356,"This swimsuit is unique, yet functional and sexy without being sluty. My only concern is it has no nipple coverage so when your nipples harden, it's visible and since it's a one piece it gives you a wedgie."
6357,Stunning love each of my purchases well made quality product love how each one feel against my body these kaftans make me look sexy I wear them everywhere get lots of compliments great customer service thank you guys for making beautiful  kaftans
6358,"This is beautifyl and it fits nicely. (I'm a 1x size.)  It hits me (5' 4"") about 4 inches above my ankle bone."
6359,"Beautiful, well made, what more can you say, if you love caftans this is the place to buy, will definitely be buying again, thank you!"
6360,"This is much prettier in person. I did not realize it was beaded. And the fabric is very rich. I am impressed! Pretty fancy, for sure!!!"
6361,"This is beautiful.  I am almost 5'11"" and it came down to my ankles, which unusual for me.  Love it."
6362,Fun and colorful! Its a perfect lightweight swimsuit cover. Thank you for the prompt shipping!
6363,"It is exactly what I wanted! Beautiful, colorful and comfortable. It arrived before I expected, which was nice. The whole transaction was flawless. I would recommend this shop to anyone."
6364,Love it! Absolutely perfect. Thank you.
6365,Parfait merci ! Offert à une amie très satisfaite.
6366,"this is my favorite swimsuit ever, I've been wearing it as a bodysuit and it's so comfy and perfect!!!! took a while to get to me, but since it was coming from Europe that's expected."
6367,"This is the cutest swimsuit!!!! Love it so much. It arrived so quickly and in perfect condition, thank you!!!"
6368,Thanks again Marisol! Xx
6369,Very disappointed I can’t even figure out how to wear it since it’s in two pieces ! So I wasted all this money for something I can’t even wear !!!!😡.... I would not recommend this top to anyone!!! I give it zero stars!
6370,"Nice material, soft, but thin and definitely just for being decorative, doesn’t stay in place not thicker secure bathing suit material that can keep covered in water At all!"
6371,This bikini is my soooo beautiful! Out of the five I bought this has to be my favourite! Fits perfectly and looks gorgeous on! And they all arrived mega quick! Defo recommend this seller! Bikinis are worth every penny! <3

6376,"This is a great bikini! The material is a little different than I expected it but I love it! Also, it is a little cheeky as you can see."
6377,So cute. Should've sized up in the bottoms but I make them work! Shop owner is extremely considerate
6378,Bikini was perfect! Seller has great customer service and works with you for sizing!
6379,Love my suit!! Fits perfect! Can’t wait to wear it to the beach.
6380,"Awsome customer service and swimsuit fits perfectly the showed mesurements.
Don't hesitate, take one! You will look awsome in it!"
6381,"The color (green) was darker than pictured and less holographic (it was a different kind of material than I thought). They don't give me as much support as I wanted, but they look cute with my Ariel top from hot topic."
6382,Thank you for getting my mermaid bottoms on time.
6383,"Shipped great, fit really cute"
6384,The cutest swim bottoms I own now! Cannot wait for summer to wear them.
6385,Mrs. Carolyn was great to work with. She patiently answered all my questions and custom made my swimsuit just as requested and it fit great. Highly recommend.
6386,"We bought suits for myself and all 4 of my daughters. The quality is superb. Bethanie was so patient with me getting measurements for everybody and figuring out which fabric choices we wanted to make.

I highly recommend this shop!

My daughters and I feel so comfortable wearing a modest suit. Last year, my girls wore modest suits I managed to sew (with the help of my midwife) for them. We got compliments everywhere we went. I was concerned my girls would feel out of place or embarrassed to have such different looking suits than everybody else, but they are so proud to be fully covered and not have to worry about being immodest!

So, this year, with these suits, which are professional quality, I know we are going to wear them with so much pride.

Thank you Bethanie! I am sure we will be back as we need to size up."
6387,"I love my custom swim suit. It's exactly what I wanted and fits perfectly! Bethany is wonderful to work with to create a comfortable, yet stylish swim suit."
6388,Bethanie is the sweetest! She is very accommodating with any custom orders and does whatever she can to please her customers. This was my 3rd order from her and I will definitely order again in the future. Highly recommend! :-)
6389,"Wow! The quality and fit exceeded my expectations!! I have the hardest time finding swimsuits that are modest and fit well, while not looking frumpy. I am very happy with this swimsuit, and I now know where I will shop for more in the future!! Thank you!!"
6390,"Great great bathing suit, it was a special made order it turned out super great , a++++  I will definitely be buying here again"
6391,"I am glad I could find this online option for buying a swim dress... I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a modest swimming dress as the name says.... 

Also, would suggest to give the measurements if they are looking for an exact fit... I haven't given measurements and asked for a medium size... The dress fit well apart from the length; I felt it would have been nice if its not that lengthier and that is my fault...

Overall I am happy with the purchase.

Thank you!"
6392,Great! Loved the choices of fabrics! FAST!
6393,Bethany is absolutely wonderful and the swimsuit fits great.
6394,Arrived very quickly and the suit looks and fits great!
6395,Comfortable fit.   Great service.  A real class act!
6396,"Absolutely amazing, gorgeous colours and lovely material. I ordered the neon green, the royal blue and the orange and they are true to colour, I cannot wait to wear them when I go on holiday! I am a small busted size 8-10 with a fairly large bum and they all fit perfectly. Fast delivery and great communication. I have recommended to all of my friends and I will be buying some more before I go away in June xxx"
6397,Loved it.  So very beautiful!!!!! Fast delivery time too.  Thank you!
6398,Love it! Thanks so much!!
6399,This is the best suit I've ever owned! And HunniBunni is fantastic to work with!!

6402,"Got it , thank you"
6403,"Got it , thank you very much"
6404,Seems like decent quality and color is nice
6405,"I love my swimsuit bottom.  It fits amazing, looks fantastic, and for the same price as buying something in a store.  I needed a rush order completed over the weekend so I could receive it via mail by Tuesday and Christy totally made my rush order the same day.  I love the retro styles of her swimwear and the great quality of her sewing.  If you were an interested buyer like I was once, I am sure you will be just as elatedly happy with your purchase as I have been with mine."
6406,"The item shipped very fast and I realized that I ordered a medium instead of a small by accident. I let the seller know and she shipped me the right size with no questions asked. It was an extremely pleasant and easy experience, nevermind how much I LOVE the bathing suit bottoms! They are so flattering, and the open cross lace up sides give just the right amount of sexiness while still being classy!!!! I would recommend these to everyone :)"
6407,This is a great swimsuit bottom. Unique and high quality tailoring. I requested a custom piece and was done timely and to a T. Great customer service as well. Highly recommend.
6408,"Ships really fast! 

I was following the sizing chart, but It is possible that I should have got a size down. Luckily the ties on the side can be adjusted.

Can't wait to wear it during my upcoming vacation to Greece"
6409,"I don't have enough words to express how happy I am with this purchase! From getting quick responses to questions or concerns I had, getting sent a swatch of fabric to make sure it matched the item I'd be wearing with the bottoms, getting them very quickly, and absolutely loving them! I can't remember the last time I was this confident in a bathing suit or this excited about one. I can't wait to wear it!"
6410,This bathing suit bottom is awesome! Really sexy on a woman with curves. :) The owner was super accommodating and got it sent out to me asap so I would have it in time for my trip. Extremely happy with my purchase! Thanks!
6411,"I LOVE this, and it arrived super fast. Thanks. Looking forward to ordering more in the future."
6412,I've ordered two pair of these bottoms and each time the product is great! I love the quality of the fabric. Christy is very professional and has a great sense of customer service. I look forward to ordering again.
6413,super fast shipping!! really high quality item- completely in love with these. <3
6414,I really love this swimsuit bottom! Very good quaility and it was exactly what I was looking for. Such a great shopping experience with awesome customer service.  I highly recommend this seller. I will be shopping here again :)
6415,"Amazing! Seller is a wonderful person to work with for custom stuff, so many options! Stitching is done well and it's very flattering :)"
6416,These look super cute on! Thanks!
6417,"Love the quality of the material, the material isnt thin and doesn't look cheap.  Its extremely flattering and the lace up is super sexy yet family friendly."
6418,Very cute!(: arrived on time! Thumbs up!
6419,"fits great, shipped on time, sexy and comfortable. zero complaints."
6420,"We have orders 5 of these awesome masks. Best made, best price, best quality, best fitting! We love them and everyone always wants to know where we got them, so we send them to Etsy and this trusted sellers...⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Star rating!!!"
6421,"I LOVE this mask!!
It’s patriotic, and I can BREATHE!! No one can tell it’s mesh!
I’ve gotten lots of comments on it.
It was delivered very fast!!
I love that I was able to do a customized size to fit me...because all the other masks I have are way too big!
This one fits perfect!!
I may have to order a few more!!"
6422,Wonderful material!!!! I can actually breathe!!!! Thank you so much
6423,My son LOVES this mask! It is all he wants to wear to school. Thank you for making these so he can breath! A+++
6424,"I ordered it with the largest vertical and horizontal sizes and it covers nicely, doesn’t fog my glasses, and it’s just enough to slide at work."
6425,Very good product! And fast shipping!
6426,"Way to Big , thought i ordered for avarage size head"
6427,The masks were exactly what I was hoping for.  Nice and breathable and not too obvious that they are mesh.
6428,Purchased 2 tops for a trip to Hawaii very soon.  They shipped very quickly and they are so cute on!  I highly recommend this seller!
6429,This is a beautiful top and very well done!
6430,Arrived quickly and exactly as described.
6431,this is the cutest bathing suit I've ever bought!! I am a size 6-8 bottom and a 34D top and got large and it fits perfect. I am going to order another one of a different color!!
6432,"I'm in love with this bikini set!! This style, and color were just what I was looking for. The seller was extremely helpful from the beginning when I had questions before purchasing, to when I needed to exchange for another size. Shipping was also rather quick. Thank you so much!!"
6433,Great quality bikinis . Seller takes care of customers
6434,"This is the best bathing suit I have ever owned. The design looks super expensive and the price is insane! This seller was also amazing, kind, and efficient. Arrived in less than a few days. Definitely recommend!"
6435,great especially for the price!
6436,Seller was super helpful!
6437,The material isn’t what I was expecting and smelled kinda weird...feels like foam and is way to thick. Shipped fast though
6438,Absolutely beautiful and very soft! Thank you so much 😍😄
6439,"Very cute, just runs a bit small. I'm 5'4"", 140#, 36C and a large was a bit snug."
6440,Great quality and looks amazing on my fiancé!  I would order again
6441,Very pretty! It's just like the picture
6442,"5'6"" 117lbs I ordered a M black bottom with the matching triangle bikini top 32D. ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE! Would 100% recommend this to everyone (nobody paid me to write this I swear lol) I follow a bunch of instagrams with cute bikinis and I love the minimalist style this is, sexy but classy! This bottom type is coming back into style and I've been searching for the perfect ones. The sizing fit so flattering I will attach photos once I hit the beach. The quality of material is great and you get what you pay for. The shipping was timely and ill eventually order in the white and lavender etc., I hope this recommendation doesn't result in matching bikinis with everyone this summer...but it would have been too selfish not to share how great this vendors product was. Purchased for my trips to Hawaii and California."
6443,"I love the high cut leg 80s style! I bought the large and it was a little big, so I just had it altered. I usually wear a US 6, 26"" waist 38"" hip. The medium may have been too small. The quality is great and I love the navy."
6444,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SELLER AND PIECES.  I was between the size M and L, and  JoEllen offered to make me a custom suit to fit my body. She took my measurements and asked a plethora of questions to ensure I receive the best fit. I'm heading to a vacation in a few days, which left her with only a week to get these to me. She finished them over the weekend and had them shipped out 2 day priority so that I could have them before I leave!

The suit fits amazing and is so so flattering. Can't wait to order more!"
6445,"Flatters the booty so well!! Perfect if you have an hourglass shape, really shows off a tiny waist with wide hips. Looked everywhere for bottoms like these, and I love them!!"
6446,Love it! Fits perfectly and came in time!
6447,"love this thong, fits perfectly"
6448,"Awesome fit, Great quality, reasonable prices and fast shipping. AWESOME!!"
6449,Awesome! Fits great!

6454,the item was as expected
6455,"Product was NOT what I expected, even after messaging shop owner on sizing. Still had a problem when I received the product. Completely disappointed, was unable to wear on my vacation!"
6456,This bikini was everything I wanted and more.! The fit is perfect and the shipping was super fast! Will be ordering again!

6463,Finaly got it ! It is just perfect <3
6464,"Thank you very much for Your work. The scarf is very beautiful. The color of the scarf is slightly different from the photo. In real life there is a lot of green. In the photo the colors seem to be black and white. But it's not scary, because under my green eyes scarf fits perfectly. Thank you)))"
6465,Beautiful scarf! Nicely packaged. Came in less than 3 weeks to Washington state.
6466,"A beautiful and breezy shawl, it's pattern is distinct and easy to distinguish even from a distance. I absolutely love it!"
6467,"lovely material and clear print, fits the body really nicely & shipping was quite fast. x"
6468,Absolutely Beautiful
6469,Love it it cheers me everytime i see it
6470,I absolutely love it!  Amazing!
6471,"thrilled with my purchase :) a very beautiful scarf, soft and cushy :)"
6472,"Gorgeous material, beautiful design. Perfect as a summer cover-up and will go with nearly everything. I love it! Thank you!"
6473,This is absolutely lovely! Love it Love it Love it!!! Looking forward to the next one!
6474,"Absolutely beautiful. Loved the light, soft cotton fabric and the design is so unique."
6475,"Incredibly soft, delicate scarf, with beautiful design. Arrived in acceptable amount of time for international delivery. Design is distinct, but soft. This is a piece to be used as a decorative accent, not for warmth or everyday wear & tear. Absolutely lovely."
6476,"I don't received the silk cotton one but a cotton scarf. Roza found a good solution for me and even if it's not what I was expected I'm very happy. I'm very pleased with my shopping experience with Shovava, the answers was fast and Roza is very attentive. So I will tell you about the cotton one. The design are gorgeous and the quality very great. I think this scarf must be better in silk cotton or better, cotton is OK but it a bit more clear on the other side. But the effect is the same, very beautiful ^^ !"
6477,"Nicely detailed thin but warm wrap, looks very striking on. Paler colour than I was expecting from the dark black suggested by the photos, but to be fair the description did say the colour might vary  from batch to batch so overall pleased with my purchase. Shipped to the UK no problems in a smart custom envelope."
6478,"I love this top—so soft and actually FITS ME!!!
Thank you!"
6479,Beautiful!
6480,lovely piece of art to wear ..... I am taking 2 scarves and making a kimono styled top to wear !!
6481,Just stunning.  Even more beautiful in person!  Thank you!
6482,The scarf is very very thin and the real colours differs from the colours on the photo. but all in all it's a wonderful scarf and I like it a lot. It's very special.
6483,I love it. Beautifully designed!
6484,"Beautiful design, soft fabric and drapes well, makes a great gift!
Thank you."
6485,"Really beautiful feather print and high quality fabric.
I'm happy to own this work of art. Thank you, Roza!"
6486,"Very light, soft and beautiful :)"
6487,The scarf is beautiful and arrived in a timely fashion. I would certainly purchase from this shop again!
6488,I think this is magnificent! Nuff said.
6489,"This is such a beautiful scarf!  I wish I would have ordered a few more, and may do so.  I'm giving this one away as a gift, and I'm sure it will be received with delight."
6490,It's a beautiful piece but very thin fabric. And could have been a little longer in length..I still my order another one in blue..
6491,an amazing addition to my wardrobe !!
6492,Beautiful as advertised. Great material and value. Good communication and delivery.
6493,Not black but blue to much effort for me to communicate About it so i gabe it away to The wonen shelter
6494,"Beautiful piece, however it was a little smaller than pictured."
6495,Shipped so fast. Very happy :)
6496,"absolutely wonderful :) fast shipping, thank you so much!"
6497,"Fabulous, thanks. Speedy shipping too."
6498,"Narrower than expected (but that may be my fault, for not considering the measures provided). The colours seem darker than pictured."
6499,Everything went well! Thank you!
6500,"Lovely items and fast shipment, thanks"
6501,"The scarf and the print are stunning fabric is soft BUT described as BLACK may have some blue tinge WELL the scarf is Navy blue all over, this has been attributed to the silk printing dyes BUT black is black not navy blue! Very disappointed purchased to go over a black evening dress. Description should be changed to dark navy blue."
6502,"Great scarf and fast shipping, thank you !"
6503,"This item is a TOTAL scam. Please be aware. THIS IS NOT SILK/COTTON. I offered proof to the seller and she said she doesnt accept that HOWEVER anyone who knows fabric knows this is synthetic. All you need to do is burn one thread and you will see. I sent the item back but postage (both ways was NOT refunded). DO NOT BUY THIS thinking it is a silk/cotton blend. On the market stall it would fetch 5 Euro if that. Also, the item has a greenish tint. Not worth it. Buyer beware."
6504,"Love this bathing suit! I have 36DDD, went with an XL, bottoms a 7, also went with a XL. LOVE IT."
6505,They run a little right because of the metal band of rhinestones. Maybe order a size up!
6506,"I absolutely LOVE laloba!!! These suits are such great quality and the customer service is beyond amazing. You’re able to send in custom measurements so you know that it will fit! This top is super cute, comfortable, and provides support. I need 10 more!!!"
6507,"This is far and away my favorite swimsuit.  It functions well as I play in and out of the water, doesn’t fall off, sturdy beautiful material, and I get lots of compliments.  I gave my measurements for a custom fit and LaLoba was attentive to detail and delivered a beautiful suit that fits my own body!  Thank you so much!  I’m referring all my friends.  💛 Shipping was fast, especially considering she made it to order."
6508,"The most perfect swim suit! I was nervous I may be between sizes so I sent Jordan my measurements and the fit for both the top and bottom is spot on. Thank you for the speedy make and ship, but most importantly your wonderful craftsmanship, Jordan!"
6509,"I love this fit, perfect for floating season!!"
6510,"Shops like these are the reason why I love etsy. I contacted the seller a week before my birthday and asked if there was even the slightest chance she would be able to ship me a suit within the week. Not only was she able to ship the suit (WITHIN A DAY!!!!) but she also asked for my measurements in order to ensure a proper fit. This is by far my favorite pair of bathing suit bottoms I own now, they fit me perfectly and they actually cover my butt. I was able to wear the suit for my b day and feel beautiful and comfortable knowing that they were made for me and my body! Thank you so much!!"
6511,"I love the classic, feminine shape and the xs fits me perfect! They’re well made and feel high quality."
6512,"I love the fabric and the quality is obvious!
Jordan responded quickly to my initial questions and I received my trunks very timely."
6513,"Beautiful swim suit, stays on, looks cute, good for swimming and lounging and playing.  I love that I gave my measurements and now I have a suit which actually works for my body.  Shipping was fast and working with LaLoba was easy.  Thank you so much!  I take it with me everywhere.  💛"
6514,I want it in every color!! Thick fabric (not see-through). True to size with stretchy fabric! I bought a Large (I wear a 29 Madewell jean). Perfect amount of cheeky!! My order shipped the day after I ordered it. LaLoba responded right away when I was concerned about sizing.
6515,Wonderful shop!! Purchased a custom top and bottom and they fit perfect. Quality materials and great attention to detail. I love that this suit makes me feel comfortable and confident. Would purchase again in a heartbeat. It’s the kind of product you wanna tell all your friends about! Thank you for making such lovely swimwear.
6516,Ordered these and the Sun top and sent my measurements. I'm happy with both but ESPECIALLY these bottoms - I wanted something truly high waisted which is hard for me to find as a tall person. They fit like a glove and I feel super comfortable in them!
6517,Heavenly. Divine. Fits like a dream!
6518,Super flattering. Perfectly made. In love.
6519,"Great suit! The color is a little different then in the photos, it's not as dark, more of a mellow mauve than maroon which isn't as flattering for my skin tone. Fits well, I keep thinking I'm going to pop out of the top, but so far so good. Thanks!"
6520,Jordan was so helpful when navigating the custom suit process. These bottoms are a beautiful fabric and the perfect fit. Can't recommend enough!
6521,A flattering cut and fit. Customize measurements ensured for a seamless fit. Thanks again!
6522,Love this bathing suit! Very well made. Jordan was so easy to communicate with and went out of her way to have it ready for me in time for a vacation this summer. Highly recommend. Thanks!
6523,"WOW! The quality and fit of all three pieces that I purchased are wonderful. I've struggled with swimwear since my son was born. These are stylish, modest, and just perfect. Thank you!"
6524,"A gorgeous colour, beautifully crafted and comfortable. My new favourite swim suit!"
6525,The swimsuit is Beautiful and fits perfect!
6526,"I love the classic modern style of this top! I initially ordered it in small and the shoulders were a bit lose on me. When I reached out to exchange it, Jordan was super helpful and really wanted to make sure I got a great fit. It’s fits perfect now! Overall, very pleased with the top and experience."
6527,Heavenly. Divine. Fits like a dream!
6528,Customer Service was amazing.  Understood exactly what I wanted.  Love Love Love!!
6529,Love it! Feels supportive and I love the unique style.
6530,"My daughter LOVES this suit! The fit could not be more perfect, and her friends are super jealous! Lisa was amazing, she works with you on the style and was more than helpful with sizing, etc.! I highly recommend Lisa and her fantastic shop!!"
6531,Words cannot express how much I love this bikini! Fits perfectly without being too revealing! Seller was also amazing enough to make sureit got to me before my girls only vegas trip! I am one very satisfied customer and will purchase from this seller again!
6532,I absolutely love my Tardis Bikini! I received an email hours after I ordered requesting my specific bra size and pant size so they can do a perfect fit. Arrived a lot quicker than I expected! I cant wait till this Chicago weather warms up so I can wear it someplace other than inside!!
6533,I ordered the TARDIS bikini for my trip to Hawaii this year and because I am a huge Doctor Who fan and I must say I LOVE IT! Perfect sizing and very well done. also easy to pay and no problems with shipping. Thanks so much!
6534,"Stunning - I LOVE it. At first I was concerned that it would be too small, but it fit like a glove. Gorgeous bikini. I can't wait for warmer weather so I can wear it. Thank you!"
6535,The bathing suit is great! It looks so good on and the material is a great quality. She even sewed in extra liners and pockets for my own inserts!
6536,It's even better then I thought I'm in love with it
6537,Adorable!
6538,Thank you so much!!! It look amazing!!! My daughter will love it!!!
6539,My bikini is made well and fits so perfectly! I am definitely pleased and would recommend this shop. :)
6540,"This is amazing and fits great. Seller was very helpful, responded quickly to all my messages and i received the product quickly."
6541,It looks  great and fit great too.
6542,Absolutely perfect!  thank you so much
6543,El diseño es muy bueno y llegó en 1 semana. Perfecto. Lo único que no me gusta es que las letras de POLICE.... parece que no son muy resistentes y se pueden caer en cualquier momento. Por el resto es una gran compra
6544,Fits perfectly and exactly as pictured
6545,Looks stunning on my girlfriend. Colour and cut exactly as displayed in sellers web page. Quick replies to email. Thanks!
6546,Very nicely put together

6557,A+!  Nice suit and sexy on my wife.  Love it!
6558,"Great buy for the money. A little less metallic than expected, but no complains for an inexpensive fun and festive suit."
6559,"Used it for an American theme party while on a trip to Toronto. Was great. Very well made. Wish it had padding, but other than that no complaints."
6560,It's a nice suit. Just wish there was padding
6561,She loved it and can’t wait to show it off!
6562,My swimsuit is amazing! I’m so in love with it. Breezie was quick to respond to all of my questions and customized my suit. She even sent it out well before the date I needed it by. I could cry because it fits so well and I haven’t found a swimsuit in years that I felt comfortable in. Thank you so much girlfriend!
6563,"Both of my customized suits (bodysuit + a velvet binki) fit perfectly!! Im amazed how she can nail such customized orders, and the rust velvet color I requested was exactly what I was invisioning. Im about to order my third suit now - definitely recommend for simply amazing / no fuss swimwear."
6564,LOVE this fabric. Beautiful color. Fit was fab.
6565,My new favorite swim suit! It fits me perfectly
6566,This is the third piece I have from this company and I am always impressed by how gorgeous and well made each piece is. Best bathing suit I have ever owned!!! ❤️❤️❤️
6567,"It’s literally Christmas in July with this emerald velvet masterpiece. So many compliments, great customer service, fits great and I immediately placed my second order."
6568,So beautiful! Really high quality and I love it. I ordered this in a nude fabric and the nude is a really nice light chocolate milky type of nude. It’s very very flattering even where I thought it wouldn’t be. Incredible!
6569,The bottom is a tiny bit large in my bum area but I absolutetly love the color and top fits great!
6570,Love this suit! It's quite comfortable and very flattering. She even found a gold velvet color fabric per my request. Will most likely be ordering more in the future. Thanks Breezie <3
6571,Love it! So well made and incredibly flattering. Purchased it custom made in green with matching scrunchy. Definitely a worthwhile purchase!
6572,Love this suit!! The color is PERFECT!
6573,Fully lined and fit perfectly! Even got a a lil scrunchie is that matches! Thanks!
6574,This fit perfectly & is very comfortable to wear & swim in!
6575,"Just received my bathing suit and I love it so much, I don’t think I’ll be buying suits from anywhere else! Thank you!!!"
6576,"Best.Fitting.suit.ever. 
This is the first suit In years that I have loved from the second I put it on. No “ getting used to it” or, “ it will grow on me”,  or “maybe 5 lbs later”, or “with a sarong? too much fabric? Too little fabric? “etc thoughts. I am talking since puberty. I’m 31 and my whole life I’ve hated bathing suits like most girls/women simply because a one size/shape fits all is just mathematically and logically in correct. This one I put on and wore for two days.. around the house, sexier than most of my lingerie and better fitting/more comfortable than my favorite jeans. I don’t know how or why, but I won’t question it. You don’t look a gift horse in the mouth. Right?"
6577,This top is exactly as pictured and very comfortable! I am a 32D and ordered a size XL for reference. I can’t wait to wear this on my upcoming vacation.
6578,I love this top!! The price point for the amazing quality is unmatched!!!!!
6579,Amazing bikini top and so stretchy and comfortable. The material feels so nice against my skin. Perfect fit on an imperfect body.
6580,"The best swimsuit I own , sexy but classy."
6581,"Very cute and well-made, but not ideal if you’re on the bustier side"
6582,I’m 5’2 and it Fit perfectly!
6583,I ordered 9 bathing suit and they arrived in a timely manner. They are good quality and fit me perfectly. This is my first one piece bathing suit and I love it. I also like how it’s lifts up my boobs and I’m not chesty but this bathing suit makes my boobs look nice. Can’t wait for the bride to see hers. Thank you so much for making these beautiful bathing suits.
6584,"I bought a total of 7 bathing suits for a bachelorette party. I am 5'7 with a 26 inch waist, 34 inch hips, and 31 inch bust. I ordered a small and the bathing suit fit great! A little tight on the shoulders, but I think a medium would've been too big. Two of the girls ordered mediums and theirs fit well too (they're around 5'3). The quality is great and they turned out so beautifully. 

Only ""downside"" was the wait during COVID times. I reached out to the owner about the delay, and she was very helpful and accommodating. I definitely recommend!"
6585,So cute! A lot of reviews said to size up so I went from my normal size Medium to a Large and it is a little big. It is still really cute though and will still be perfect for pictures.
6586,"AMAZING, it fit perfect. I am a true medium and bought the medium."
6587,Came in time for Bach party and super cute. Great fit on our different body types !
6588,Loved these suits! Very comfortable and nice fabric. The imprint was good quality and we did not have any issues. The suits arrive quickly & TotallyBrides was so communicative!
6589,"I got these for me and my bridemaids, I love them! Quality is great, true to size and added the perfect touch for my gifts"
6590,The bathing suits I ordered for my bachelorette came in more than enough time and are perfect! They are true to size according to the measurements listed. The shop owner is AMAZING to work with! She writes back sooner than 24 hours. My first package was lost via USPS and she sent a duplicate order out the next day via fedex and it was here in 48 hours. Excellent customer service! Will most definitely shop with her again!
6591,"The seller was very easy to work with, and she created a custom design for us! The swim suits are very thick and the lettering doesn’t look like it’ll come off easily, so overall they’re great quality! The only issues I have with them are (1) they seem very short. When standing up straight, the swim suits are squeezing our shoulders and bottoms. However, this is my first one piece swim suit so maybe that’s to be expected, or maybe we should have sized up - not sure! And (2) the brides swim suit has a mark on it already. This is a gift for her, so it’s kind of disappointing that I have to give her something that’s already smudged."
6592,The XL is alittle short on me and I am only 5’2 but they are super cute !
6593,"Seller was helpful and responsive. The colors look great, and the customization is exactly what I asked for. I ordered a size up, and the swimsuit is a little big in the shoulders/back area."
6594,Great customer service & awesome swim suit!
6595,"This suit looks great, but there is no padding or support in the top. The back is also very open which makes it not stay on as well. The lettering looks great though!"
6596,Thank you so much for my order it came out to be beautiful! Will order some more soon!
6597,Perfect! better than expected! love
6598,very helpful when i asked questions about sizing. product is well made and a great quality. i ordered the black swimsuit with gold print. i would order again.
6599,Perfect! I can't wait to wear it on our girls trip!!!!
6600,"Super cute, amazing quality and it fits perfectly! Cannot wait to wear this at my bachelorette party!"
6601,Me and my girlfriends ordered from this shop and all got different fonts
6602,We ordered a white and 6 black suits. All were customized and came out great! Definitely size up to make sure it's comfortable. Lettering stayed in tact even after a wash.
6603,They surprisingly looked better than expected
6604,Good quality !
6605,"It fits perfect and the quality is very nice, I can’t wait to wear it!"
6606,"Swimsuit is made good but runs small so purchase a size up and if you have a bigger chest this is not supportive, I have a DD chest and it doesn't fit my chest well at all. Also my lettering is already coming off the suit and I haven't worn it to the bachelorette party weekend yet... contacted seller she helped me so much and sent me another one with no problems 😊"
6607,"The whole suit fit very strange...
Not satisfied"
6608,"This came out better than expected. I bought this as a gift for a bridal shower, but now I want to order one for myself."
6609,Too bad I have to leave even one star. Wouldn't recommend this shop to anyone. All bridesmaids ordered swimsuits for my sister's Bachelorette party... We all paid different prices for the same suit..some only had $18- $20 wrapped up in this.. One $25...me... I paid $47ish ($34 for just the suit)... Yeah never again! Several of us contacted their customer service to make sure it would be here on time... One had free express shipping.. I had to pay $12 extra... Some came in two days some came three weeks later.. One bridesmaid received a white suit instead of the black she ordered. My suit showed up at 7pm the night before I needed it. Save yourself money and anxiety and shop elsewhere.
6610,great gift for all the bridesmaids to celebrate a fun weekend
6611,Love the swimsuit. Can’t wait to wear it for the bachelorette.
6612,"This is well made and is a nice product, however, fits on the small side. Size up if you have a chest or a mid-section."
6613,"Very cute, open back and well made"
6614,it never was delivered and I got an apology blaming transit
6615,I ordered wife of the party suit with gold writing but got bride & boujee in pink writing
6616,great product but it arrived a week later than expected.
6617,I ordered a size up and it still is very small.
6618,I don't know the quality because it's been a month since I've ordered it and STILL have not received it. Probably won't receive it before I leave for the bachelorette I'm attending.
6619,I placed my order three weeks ago and the promise date was 08/13. These are for my bachelorette party next week. I am devastated to say that these have not even been shipped. The shop has not contacted me back within 24 hours or even a week for that matter. Very hard to work with. Place your orders 5-6 weeks in advance. Or else your bachelorette party staples will not get there. Can’t even blame Covid for this one but thank you for continuing to make my 2020 bridal experience terrible.
6620,runs very very very small.
6621,"I'm sure this is a gorgeous suit.... however, I along with the rest of the bridal party ordered these on July 13th and have yet to receive them even though the shipping time says 3-5 days. My item has been ready to ship since july 28th which was over a week ago but doesn't even show it has left the seller. I have reached out twice with no response. Communication with these people is terrible! Even with delays due to Covid 19, a notification of some type or a simple response would have been appreciated."
6622,such nice fabric and quality cant wait to wear it!
6623,"amazing as always, I have lots of bikinis from this shop and they always fit amazing, super flattering and good quality"
6624,This is so cute! It fits really well and it’s great quality. Thanks!
6625,super sexy i love this came quick too
6626,It's great! Super cute and skimpy and fits well.
6627,"Good stuff, she got it dirty as soon as it came in 👌"
6628,Oh my! I absolutely love this. Very well made. Looks and feels good. It's a little small. So I ordered a new one L. I love it. I hope that it not to big.. the shipping is so fast. This piece is to die for.. so hot.....
6629,I have spent years searching for the best cheeky bottoms. I spent so much money on Victoria Secret and other brand names and then I came across this! So inlove! The best bottoms I’ve ever owned. Def buying more in the future! :)
6630,Very pleased with this idem.  Looks great and was really impressed with the quality of the fabric.  Will shop here again.
6631,My order got lost in the  mail and the owner is sending me a new order free of charge.  Good business Etiquette
6632,"Well made, good quality, good fit."
6633,"I ordered a large and it was still by small. I usually am a M or an L, my pants size 10... I can wear this bikini but it really digs into my sides."
6634,"I purchased this as a surprise for my wife . I haven't given it to her yet, but Im sure she will like it as much as I do"
6635,"Got this crochet top for a 70’s boat party. It was was SO cute, perfectly fitting and excellent quality. I got the padding and lining so it’d be a little sturdier. Love it!"
6636,The padding & lining definitely made my crochet top even more comfortable!
6637,"Padding is excellent! Not the thin bikini padding like I expected it to be, so I'm more than please with it!!"
6638,Shipping was fast and upon opening my package I simply loved my crotchet top. The top looked better in person than online.
6639,"Sadly after receiving this the UK weather went downhill, still wore it on a few nights out and it's lovely, so pleased with it."
6640,"Had padding added to crop top, was perfectly sewn in"
6641,"Amazing item, purchase it now!"
6642,The padding is great it's not all thin and flimsy!
6643,"The seller was so quick to message me back. Very responsive and very flexible to what I wanted and worked with me on what was doable. I am SO very happy with this purchase! 🥰 

For size reference:
I got the medium. 
I am 5’4 and weigh 150lbs. 
My measurements are:
Bust: 36”
Waist: 29”
Hips: 42.5”"
6644,"This is my second bikini from this shop. The turnaround time is amazing. This bathing suit fits better then any bathing suit you could buy at a high end store
. Looks fabulous"
6645,Super cute and flattering
6646,"Gorgeous bikini! Although it took about a month from ordering to arrive, it was completely worth it. Also, the bikini is handmade, so I understand the time it takes. The fit is super flattering and has just enough stretch. For reference I am normally a size small and 34c, and the size small fit perfectly. Can't wait to wear it on an upcoming trip in April!"
6647,It fits perfectly!!! So well made❤️❤️❤️❤️
6648,Super cute!!!! Looks like the expensive brand!
6649,Beautiful workmanship.  You won’t be disappointed.
6650,Loved the bathing suit I ordered for my bridal party!  The quality was great and it looked amazing :)
6651,"The swimsuit came out nice. I ordered a custom rose gold swimsuit for my bachelorette cruise. It was more of a peach than rose gold, not as pictured. Seller had horrible communication and very slow to respond to questions and messages. Production and shipping was also very delayed and I almost didn’t get it in time even though I ordered with plenty of anticipation based on sellers shipping disclosure."
6652,I absolutely loved my swimsuit. It fits great! I asked them to write and “barbie” cursive font and they made it perfect!
6653,The shop worked with me to make sure I was able to get the design I wanted and making sure I got it in time. They were fast in responding to any question I had. I needed it before my honeymoon in June and I already have it! It is PERFECT!
6654,"Suit is SO cute and fits perfectly. I love that it still has butt coverage, and includes bra pads as well. This is a great suit, very reasonably priced and great quality! Would definitely buy again. Fits true to size."
6655,Great quality and nice fitting bathing suit! I did size up one size and I think it’s a more comfortable fit. Great speedy service!
6656,Great quality suit! Shipping could have been faster though.
6657,I absolutely loveee my bathing suit for my bachelorette party coming up!! Will definitely order again!!
6658,Came so much faster than I expected!
6659,Great quality just very high cut
6660,Arrived on time and well package
6661,It’s beautiful!!! Fast shipping! Thank you! Will def order again in the future!
6662,"I gave measurements to Amber's bikinis but both times the bikini was not sized correctly and came in too small. I am not sure where the wires got crossed, but it somehow did. It's too bad...a great price and a nice person, just could not get the right fitting."
6663,"Beautiful fabric, perfect sizing. Thank you."
6664,"Perfect. bikini received in a week, size fits, good color and material."
6665,Er ist sehr sexy und passgenau
6666,Timely shipping and an excellent seller! Thank you !
6667,"This top is perfect for those with small breasts, I have always had a problem when getting swim suits because I felt like they were either covering every single thing or the padding is way to big, and when I put this top on, I finally knew what it felt like to have a swimming top that actually fits to my size! I love it! And I also didn’t have to worry about swimming and my top getting lose and flashing everyone, no matter what I did it stayed in the exact place it was supposed to and the material is also pretty thick which is exactly what I like! Thank you so much!! And I will continue to support you guys!!💙💙"
6668,This top was perfect! I'm a 34DDD and the XL fits perfectly.
6669,"sexy, seamless and fits great. i love the looseness so nothing pulls in places it shouldn’t! Iffi is lovely to work with. Can’t wait to hit the beach!!"
6670,"thank you very much, i love your Bikinis and will order more."
6671,"thank you very much, i love your Bikinis and will order more."
6672,"Turned out better than I even thought it could. Fits great is very well made, wondering if I should get more!"
6673,So cute and great fit!
6674,Fits perfectly great quality love it!
6675,Very well made and sweet! Great communication and shipped promptly.  Five twinkling stars! 😘💛
6676,"I ordered it in April, to be sure to get it in june. Now, I still haven't received it. One month ago the seller told me ""sorry, I've been late in my work, it will be shipped by saturday"". Then nothing, I wrote again and the answer was like ""sorry I made a mistake in the shippings, it will be shipped by..."". Then nothing. I wrote again last week : ""sorry life is unpredictable, it will be shipped by wednesday"". It was one week ago I I still haven't received an email withshipping references. And I now see that the seller took holidays! Does she just take me for a fool?"
6677,"I needed a bridal swimsuit for my bachelorette trip and this met my expectations! The seller is VERY helpful, quick responses, and will tell you what size you need to exact! If you’re not sure about the size please message her. I was between sizes and we kept having issues with what I wanted and what she had in-stock, so she ended up sending me the one I wanted in the first place for free due to the complications!! So sweet! I ordered 2 and she replied that she sent me a happy with them, and it was the exact one I wanted! Very pleased and received so many compliments."
6678,This suit is perfect.  The owner is a doll and there was a minor hiccup and she fixed everything extremely fast and was amazing to work with.  I love everything about this suit. Not a lot of suits work with my mom bod and it is beautiful and sexy.
6679,"Love it! Cute, classy, and the right amount of sexy! It's well made and fits well. Would be perfect if there's thicker padding for the chest area.

Kerry is super friendly and helpful!"
6680,Best swimsuit I have ever had! Sooo comfortable and so flattering.
6681,💗💗💗
6682,Parfait. Conforme au descriptif. Reçu rapidement. Merci
6683,So glam! Great seller communication and shipping.
6684,"This suit is a hit! So sexy and comfortable. I love all the side boob it shows too! Ashley worked with me to change the back to more of a Brazilian fit. The shipping was fast and she answered all my questions.

I ordered a size small. I'm 5'6, 34DD, size 25/26 in pants."
6685,Love it hugs perfect but you just sent me the camo one instead of all black but it's still beautiful thanks!
6686,The bikini fit amazing l loved it and the seller responds quickly will be purchasing again. Good quality also
6687,"I love this swim suit!  It goes great with the curves of my hips and booty.  

The only problem I had was my size B cup boobs popping out when I moved, or bend forward.  I'm sure I'll figure it out.  

I would totally recommend anyone to get this bathing suit."
6688,Great fit & design! Shipped quickly & Ashley was fantastic to work with.
6689,"I am beyond thrilled with this swimsuit! I put it on and all of a sudden I looked like the pin-up bodied version of myself. It just proportionizes you in the best possible way. Cathy and Justine were so easy to work with, just lovely people. I will absolutely order from this shop again."
6690,"I absolutely LOVE this swimsuit! I went with custom sizing because it is difficult for me to find a suit that fits my wide hips but isn’t too big for my small bust. The moment I slipped this one up my legs I knew it was going to be perfect! WilmasPast NAILED it. It’s got full coverage behind, holds in my mom-tummy, and keeps me appropriate up too while I swim with my kids. THANK YOU for making a swimsuit that fits me!"
6691,"This is such a beautiful, flattering swimsuit! It makes me look like I have curves even though I have quite an athletic build. This is my second purchase from this lovely shop and sure won’t be the last! Great communication, the quality and craftsmanship, attention to detail is amazing and very fast shipping. Love to the power of infinity :))"
6692,Gorgeous! I was initially worried the mallard blue was too bright for me (when dry is lighter than in photo) but it looked great and was darker in the water. The fit is perfect and very flattering. I will definitely be buying my next swimsuit here!
6693,Wow! Absolutely gorgeous! So flattering and fits like a dream! I’m beyond thrilled. The quality and craftsmanship is high end designer level & the sellers are so nice! Thanks so much!!! ❤️
6694,"This is the best fitting swimsuit I’ve ever owned. It’s super cute! I’ve gotten many compliments on it. I’ll be ordering another one. The shop owners were great too,  with communication and promptness with making and shipping my order."
6695,It is the most amazingSwimsuit I’ve ever bought and it fits me like a glove can’t wait to show off my new body
6696,"This swimsuit is exactly what I was hoping for, and I had a great experience with the seller.  I originally reached out before buying because my timeline was short. They confirmed that they could get me the suit in time, and it even ended up arriving a couple of days early. They were also very patient about explaining the measurements to me, and the end result fits perfectly and looks amazing."
6697,This is easily the most flattering swimsuit I've ever worn! The owners were quickly responsive to my questions and took pains to make sure I got the perfect fit. Thanks!
6698,"The suit fits amazingly! I hate how I look in a suit anyway, but this makes me feel cuter."
6699,I purchased this and the Esther swimsuit and I LOVE them both! They are perfect and by far the best swimsuits I have ever had. The fit is perfect. Thank you Wilma's Past I will definitely be purchasing more!!
6700,Excellent communicate and received my suit very quickly! It's very flattering and seems quite well-made.
6701,This is one of the best swimsuits I will probably ever own. Now that I has custom ordered a swimsuit I’m not sure I can ever go back to picking a general sized one off of a store rack
6702,"Love the print and just ordered another suit today.  I am going to give detail measurements on new order.  I would like smaller top (I am 36D) and at age 57....more coverage on the bottom.  This suit  is XL in top and bottom.  I an also 5'9"" for reference."
6703,"Love this bathing suit!! 
Would definitely order another from love Lucy bea :)"
6704,Such a cute suit. Fits perfect! Only downside is the top is not padded at all so will have to wear petals underneath it

6739,This top fits perfect!!! I am 34DD and fall out of every bikini top. It was customized to me and she listened to exactly what I wanted (including straps and coverage)
6740,"Such beautiful, eco-conscious craftsmanship! The Organic Cotton fabric is so soft against my skin and when I put it on I can feel all of the love that was put into each stitch. The seller was so kind and genuine and I can tell they really care about what they are sending out into the world 💗 I also have to note that I have a reasonably large chest and the M/L fits me like a glove with plenty of support for my ladies! Thank you PrimitiveTribalCraft I look forward to getting some more of your sweet threads in the future!"

PrimitiveTribalCraft is responsive to inquiries and super helpful. Great sexy styles for ladies and gents."
6745,Love my new bikini so much! Thank you!
6746,My favorite bikini I've ever owned. Extremely comfortable. I actually like to work in the top. I love how it fits me!
6747,Absolutely love the way the bikini lays against the body. It is a very flattering shape and I love the material.
6748,Very helpful seller in every way. Great quality bikini it seems. Awesome everything! I'm happy!
6749,Super cute! Happy to have a underwear/bathing suit set made of natural materials finally.
6750,I love these bikinis .. thank you
6751,"Perfect, thank you so much !!"
6752,"Fast shipping, Beautiful bikini pieces"
6753,bikini lies nicely and the material is pleasant and slightly elastic :)
6754,Very comfortable and beautiful... thank you!
6755,Had high hopes but then noticed a small hole on right bikini triangle. Unsure if it was used or a moth got into the warehouse....Disappointed
6756,"loved the suit; had to return it to size up. returning was easy, seller is a great communicator. bigger suit is perfect!"
6757,Multi-item order. Amazing suit. Unique and comfortable.
6758,Nice color and material
6759,Great suit! Quality and comfortable plus super sexy!!! I know my guy keeps asking me to wear this one!
6760,"Good quality, and packed well.  The first visor I received was pretty tight, and I have a small head.  The seller was nice enough to offer to send me a new one.  Since they are handmade the sizes will vary.  You may want to measure your head and include that in a purchase note."
6761,"Absolutely beautiful hat, so thrilled I ordered it. Quite a snug fit, perhaps I have a large head, but fine and the brim is lovely and deep for good shade from the sun. Only took a couple of weeks to arrive too. Thanks so much!"
6762,This hat is so cute and perfect. It fits perfectly and doesn’t make my head hot.
6763,I love this hat! It’s very well made! I’ve worn it a few times already to beach and pool and have gotten compliments on it!
6764,Love it!! Exactly as described!! Thank you!!
6765,Love this visor. Very stylish and affordable!
6766,"Got ot taday and I 
💖💖💖 it!!!!"
6767,Love it! Perfect fit and created very nicely.
6768,Great hat!  Quality material and fits perfect.
6769,A little tight around the head but love it otherwise.
6770,Perfect. Exactly as picture. Fast shipping
6771,Very well made
6772,perfect fit and was delivered faster than expected!
6773,The hat is great but a bit on the small side.
6774,"When I submitted the order, I realized it was an outdated shipping address and immediately reached out to the seller. Fortunately, she said she could update the address before sending. Unfortunately, the address was never updated. The shipping updates and delivery confirmation I received all referenced the old shipping address and I never received my item."
6775,This was too small for my normal-sized head. It would probably fit a child.
6776,I'm in love! The suit looks exactly as pictured. This is the only suit/skirt I've been able to find that provides 'modesty' without sacrificing on style. So happy with my purchase. Bonus - it shipped incredibly quickly!
6777,Super excited about my gorgeous retro swimsuit! Thank you so much for being so easy to work with.
6778,Such a cute piece and the quality is very good.
6779,Great for hiding trouble spots but still curve hugging and sexy!
6780,"Fits great! I went a size larger than I would buy in regular clothes & it was the right choice for me. Great coverage on the booty & not fussy when I move around. Their shipping is always super on point, too."
6781,Super flattering and fits great in all the right places. Might even order a second one in a diff color.
6782,Perfect in every way!  I’m hoping for more colors next summer!
6783,"Sue, you rock - not only fabulous products but clear communication from the kindest and most helpful of sellers.  Not my first sarong from you and will not be the last - this one is glorious (and still managed to get across the Pacific in just over a month despite it all.  Longer postage times and unanticipated delays along the way are a non-negotiable fact of life right now, and the pleasure of receipt is no less for something that's out of our control at both ends.)"
6784,I will definitely buy more colors! The size is perfect. I wear a 6/8 skirt
6785,"Beautiful the color, material very good quality. You can't go wrong with this purchase."
6786,"Shipped quickly, nice quality, beautiful color! Seller is very responsive"
6787,"I loved it. i wish i would’ve known it was for smaller bust women, but i love it. it’s perfect for work"
6788,Merci beaucoup
6789,It is a beautiful outfit.
6790,Exactly as pictured
6791,Love it! Beautiful workmanship! Communicative seller!
6792,Fits my wife perfectly; a better job could not have been done!  The quality is readily apparent in such a well made item!  Highly recommended!
6793,"Took longer than described. Top not as I asked it to be. Seller offered to change it, but that would take even more time, on top of the several extra weeks it already took them."
6794,"I am always anxious about buying online because I am curvy. My waist is 29.5 and my hips are 41 inches so I was very nervous about purchasing the bottoms. I did order an XL, and it fit great! I am happy with my purchase."
6795,"I’m 5 foot tall, 94lbs and this bathing suit fit amazingly. I ordered small bottoms and medium top, but I could have ordered a large for alittle more coverage. All in all, absolutely beautiful bathing suit! ❤️"
6796,I wouldn’t say they’re completely seamless but stretchable enough to fit well. Perfect amount of coverage for me and soft material
6797,Love these bottoms... quick shipping to Hawai’i...
6798,Came with a pretty noticeable tear in the side seam
6799,I like how my butt looks like
6800,"Ordered 3 weeks ago, we thought the package got lost. Turns out they don't have the item I selected. They were nice about it but I'm frustrated by the fact I had to contact them multiple times to get answers! Ended up asking for refund."
6801,Love it ! ❤️ Great fit !
6802,Super quick shipping and the top looks exactly as pictured with solid construction and a good fit.  Looking forward to using it this summer!
6803,The bottom fits great and is made well.
6804,"very pretty, works as a top with a high waisted jean"
6805,Fits well and the shipping was very fast.
6806,only complaint is that’s there’s no way to remove the cups from the top without having to cut a little hole yourself but other than that i love it
6807,I only gave it 4 stars because the bottoms weren’t stitch right.
6808,"LOVE! Perfect fit!  I was hesitant ordering a suit online but this one is simply perfection. I'm 5' 9"" 140# got a small in the top and string bottom. Looking to order another set, small is perfect and m would probably also have worked if I wanted more coverage"
6809,Love this bottom.. I have multiple colors!
6810,"These are adorable, and they fit great!"
6811,I'm absolutely in live with this playsuit! Fits like a glove and I love that my pinup name is embroidered. Thank you!
6812,"The suit is perfect, great quality and fabric! The only reason it doesn't get full score is because the shipping was a bit delayed, but all in all I am super happy!"
6813,"Fits great! Thanks so much, I can’t wait to wear this to car shows all summer!"
6814,Very comfortable with very nice fabric and design!
6815,Amazing quality!
6816,My new favorite swim bottoms! So cute and comfortable. Very flattering! Definitely will purchase again
6817,My new favorite swim bottoms! So cute and comfortable. Very flattering! Definitely will purchase again.
6818,"She absolutely loves them, and looks for opportunities to wear them swimming or even just around the house due to being so comfortable! Be wary of washing them with anything that has Velcro, as the hooks will damage the appearance of the fabric."
6819,Love these! I have 2 different colors and plan to purchase more. Great for Lake Havasu and other Lake days
6820,So pink and cute fit perfectly
6821,Love it! Fits perfect and looks amazing
6822,"Very well made again, and slightly customized this time (will definitely be sharing some more ideas soon!).

She says they are some of the most comfortable bikini bottoms she's ever had, and often wears them as underwear now.. Gonna have to give her a big selection :D."
6823,"Bought a sexy gift for my wife, and she (and I obviously) loved it.  Will definitely be back to order more in the future."
6824,So cute thanks!
6825,"One-piece swimsuit fits me to my measurements, very flattering! Highly recommend this shop for any custom swimsuit needs :)"
6826,"I like my new swimsuit. The top part fits a little bit bug but it's workable. The bottoms fit GREAT! From reading others reviews about the shipping time, I made sure to order in enough time to have it in time for my trip. Took about 2 weeks or less. Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Thanks Lucybea."
6827,I absolutely love my suit. It fits right in all the right places. I gave her my measurements and she made it according to my size. I gave her a date a needed it by before my vacation and it arrived before then. The only downside would be the amount of time it took to make the monokini. I would suggest ordering at least a month or so in advanced. It is summer and I'm sure she's slammed with orders.
6828,"I just received my beautiful wine colored ruffled swim suit! I am very pleased with the material and craftsman ship! Its adjustable ties help it conform to my curves, it covers all the right places and showcases everything I love about my body! As a bigger lady I find it difficult to find a swimsuit I am comfortable in when I go places. As a young lady it still allows me to be fun and sexy. My new sexysuit and I will be going in a trip this weekend for sure! ☺️"

6833,I really like my bathing suit! I requested a specific date for it to be arrived by and it was on time. The suit fits me perfectly :)
6834,Stunning and beautiful color!!!! Thank you for making it beautiful!
6835,Beautiful suit and very well made. Fits like a glove! Looking forward to the summer😊
6836,Perfect! Thank you!!😘
6837,I ordered the nude colored monokini with regular bottom. I’ve already purchased a second one ! It’s super flattering and comfy. I suggest ordering as soon as possible as shipping may be delayed due to covid. Totally worth the money.
6838,"Seriously, best swimsuits ever.  Going to buy many many more."
6839,I sent all of my information--and when picking the size for the bottom I specifically said I wasn't sure if I needed to go with a small or medium and asked for her advice. I also gave exact bra size. All in all the whole suit was too small. She was not willing to do any adjustments! I spent a lot of money for something I cannot wear as my butt and boobs are hanging out. When I messaged her she said she could only downsize and I informed her I would try and locate someone local to help and she did not say anything back--not a sorry or anything. :(
6840,The triple layer material used in this swimsuit is really effective in shaping and sculpting. This bathing suit is really flattering and sexy! Shipping was also fast.
6841,I feel soooo sexy in this butter smooth 1 piece bathing suit. It gives me an amazing hourglass figure and is very flattering on my butt as well. Just a teensy bit tight on the boob area but honestly still very much worth getting. I can adjust my girls around anyway! Would DEFINITELY order again!! It arrived so fast too!! Having a child does not let me have the confidence in wearing a tiny bikini anymore but this restored my faith that I still got it! lol
6842,This arrived really quickly and is very high quality. I've accidently purchased a number of unlined or very thin swimsuits and this one is so much nicer. It's thick and well constructed. It's also very flattering and comfortable. Very happy with my purchase. Thank you!
6843,This suit makes me feel pretty. Thank you!
6844,Very high quality!  Great value and looks great!
6845,"Wow ! This swimsuit fits amazing ! I have usually a hard time finding a nice one that doesn't make you look fat. This swimsuit is perfect, it doesn't cut your body yet holds everything in place and looks sexy ! 
Thanks !"
6846,Fits like a glove & is sooo flattering!!!
6847,love this swim suit. Perfect fit!
6848,My bathing suit arrived very quickly! It's very pretty and very soft with lovely colours. I think it's very pretty while still being modest. Thank you very much.
6849,Absolutely love this swimsuit! So well made and such a beautiful design!  Excellent seller!
6850,"Fits perfect, and looks just as gorgeous in person!"
6851,"Recieved just in time for my girlfriend's cruise, pretty color swatches and design. However, the piping wasn't centered and the bottom was too tight and rode up. Was not able to return it."
6852,Beautiful swimsuit. Very flattering.
6853,Perfect!! I'm stoked to bust this out. The cut is exactly what I was looking for.
6854,I love it! It fits great! It looks exactly like the picture.  I have always been pleased with shop!!!
6855,Oh mahhhh gawddddd I loveeeeeee thissss!!!! Thank you AGAIN for the swimsuit! It fits perfectly! So happy! As always! Super fast shipping!
6856,Love this bottom!! Great quality and it fits perfectly. I'll definitely be ordering more!
6857,Fits perfectly
6858,"I am so happy with this bottom!! I was nervous about trying a thong, but I can never find a bottom that fits my larger butt and small waist so I just went for it. I purchased from VS, Venus, and every swimsuit retailer in between and none have ever fit me the way these do. I feel confident and sexy wearing them and I'm going to pass on information about this shop to everyone else I know who has difficulty ""buying off the shelf"" from popular swim brands. Thank you a thousand times over!!!"
6859,A little higher of a rise then I had hoped but I still love it!  Great look !
6860,These are beautifully made and arrived in a snap! Can't wait to be bold and fearless and wear a thong bikini in public! Thanks!
6861,They're perfect! I have the same bottoms in black and I can't wait for more colors!
6862,Cutest bottoms I own by far!! Thank you so so much
6863,It was shipped on time and I loved it!
6864,Incredible quality! So impressed!
6865,exactly as described and well made. thank you
6866,Shipped quick.  High quality. Great price.
6867,fast response from seller when an issue arised.
6868,Will be ordering again :)
6869,"It makes my less than A cup boobs look bigger!!!! I love it, it's a suit top that really gives me confidence and flatters my shape!!"
6870,"Love it, I have a small cup size and it still fits very flattering and is hot! 🔥"
6871,"Love this bikini top! After it arrived and I tried it on, I immediately went to order a second one in a different color."
6872,The cut was way too narrow (and tall/high) to actually wear. It was a very odd triangle. The straps were also very needlessly long.
6873,Shipped quickly and good quality.
6874,Returned item it was the size for a 12 year old! :-(
6875,These are of real good quality. The shipping was quick and I even got free stuff with my order. I will definitely be ordering from them again. I am an island girl and I love that this are the full size sarong. Any islander would appreciate these and would love the seller and products as well. Faafetai Tele Lava. Mahalo
6876,"My son and daughter-in-law love their matching sarongs!
Mahalo!"
6877,Exactly what I wanted and it arrived so quickly! Mahalo!!!
6878,Great speedy service! Nice designs on the pareo.  Will be ordering more in the future.
6879,"Great product quality, great delivery and free gifts ☺️"
6880,Thanks for this great product:)
6881,Excellent service and product! Will order again.
6882,Love!! The bottoms are very well made and the Palm green color is beautiful! Will definitely order more!
6883,The material for this bathing suit is soft and the suit is very well made. Color is true to the description.
6884,Love!! Beautiful color & fabric is so soft. Fit is fantastic.
6885,The medium was a bit small but still beautiful and soft. I ended up ordering two other pairs in large.
6886,"I absolutely love this! It’s so perfect for the beach, ideal material, PERFECT colour! I couldn’t be more happy when this arrived!"
6887,I was happy with 1 of the 2 sarongs I purchased. The Teal one is fantastic! Perfect for the beach! The black sarong shredded the first time I wore it. Very bummed about that. I wear sarongs alot since I live on a tropical island. I've only had a wrap shred like that when it was very old. Too bad I thought I found my new source.
6888,Have ordered 3 of these. Arrived today beautiful colours and great quality. Will definitely purchase again. So hard to find good sarongs.
6889,"Perfect! Just what I was looking for, nice light, airy scarf/sarong."
6890,"Perfect! Just what I was looking for, nice light, airy scarf/sarong"
6891,"Gute Qualität, gute Verarbeitung, empfehlenswert!"
6892,"Gute Qualität, gute Verarbeitung, empfehlenswert!"
6893,The scarf is perfect. Perfect shade of red. I can’t wait to wear it!
6894,"Lovely color, emerald green and quick shipping. Haven't had a chance to wear it to the beach but know I will love it"
6895,"Good colour and quality, its lightweight and breathable. It’s pure cotton thought so it is prone to wrinkles, handle with care."
6896,"My mother in law chose this wrap specifically, and was very pleased with the received item. She's taken it away on holiday, so sure it will be well used! It was received within the week. Thank you."
6897,I ordered these for the hot summer days and they are perfect.  Not only do they help me stay cool but I feel very soft and feminine in them.  Quick delivery to US as well.
6898,Exactly what I wanted and how it was described x fast delivery
6899,Just as described. Thank you.
6900,"The absolute best! I spent most of my vacation in these coverups. The floor-length was just perfect...and I am 6'2""! Definitely plan to buy more in other colors! Thanks so much!"
6901,"The absolute best! I spent most of my vacation in these coverups. The floor-length was just perfect...and I am 6'2""! Definitely plan to buy more in other colors! Thanks so much!"
6902,"First of all Sarah's customer service is perfection. She is the example everyone else should use on how to treat a customer and how to run a successful Etsy shop. I first purchased this cover up for my wife for our honeymoon four years ago. It's extremely elegant and she loved it so much she asked me to purchase another, so I did! Soon I expect she'll want more a dim happy to come back to buy again."
6903,Beautiful color
6904,Fantastic customer service. Superior quality item and perfect. Shipped in time and I will be buying more and highly recommend.
6905,"The swimsuit is perfect! I could’ve maybe gone for a small but the medium fits comfortably. I messaged the seller before purchasing because I wanted to be sure I would get it before my bachelorette trip to Miami, she replied right away and assured me I would get it in time and I did! I’m very satisfied and definitely recommend her shop!"
6906,So quick to receive and fits perfect! cannot wait to wear for my bachelorette party!
6907,I wish the stars went higher than 5! My items shipped perfectly and my items were flawless. Dragana does amazing work! I have already purchased three of her suits and love them all! I even asked her to accommodate my modest nature by altering my suit a bit. And she made the most perfect alterations based off of measurements she still had saved from last year! Love her and her products. Great work and Thank You again!
6908,"Such an amazing shop! The owner is fabulous, she took an existing design in her shop and made a custom order. It arrived promptly and I'm very satisfied with the fit. Will order again!"
6909,Very beautiful and she customized the color based on my request  :-)  Thank you darling!
6910,Amazing bikini! Very kind seller!
6911,"I love , fits perfectly"

6918,"The bikini made by Dragana is AMAZING!!!!!
Dragana was able to make a completely custom piece, perfect for my size and to my design request. Communication was frequent and efficient and item shipped quickly. Despite an issue with delivery, Dragana was patient and persisted in ensuring the item was delivered to me. Couldn't be happier and highly recommend this seller!!! LOVE!"
6919,"Die Farbe ist wunderschön und einzigartig. Der bikini sitzt perfekt, und das häkelmuster ist fein, und genau :) das warten lohnt sich"
6920,"It's just so well made and crazy beautiful! If you have a rather large bust it can be a bit revealing, but it covered all the important parts. Pom was so lovely as well and made my piece in such a short time on very short notice! Thank you so much, I loved wearing it and received a ton of compliments!"
6921,"Just like described, good quality and beautiful design. Bottom is a bit cheeky!"
6922,Nice..ample fit..just a tough suit to look good in!
6923,Love my bikini! I ordered on a Tuesday and had my suits on a Wednesday with overnight shipping ! Love them and they fit perfectly! I have an XL bottom.
6924,"Hardest part was choosing a color! So many beautiful color choices.  Color was true to chart.  Swimsuit was of excellent quality and very well made.  It arrived super fast too.  Do not hesitate to order from her.  I'm very pleased, will return soon!"
6925,Fits perfect! Love this color on my skin tone!
6926,"LOVE how this looks!
It fits so wonderfully and makes me feel so incredibly sexy"
6927,"love it, great seller communication and fast shipping. looks so cute!!"
6928,Bikini was just as pictured. Fit great. And the shipping was really fast. Will be buying from here soon!!
6929,Fits amazing and is made very well!
6930,Cup size smaller than advertised.
6931,"The color is beautiful, the fit is a bit weird. I’m a 32/34 B so I didn’t think I’d have a problem. But the top doesn’t really stay put and it’s hard to lay out on your back with a big knot in the back to keep the top tight. Overall a beautiful bathing suit and i will be wearing it again, but just for information. Xox"
6932,"I love this bikini! Beautifully made and very flattering, post baby this is just what I needed! The seller is incredibly helpful, an absolute pleasure to buy from!"
6933,"Adorable! I love this suit in person, really great fabric. It is a flattering style and it fits perfectly, the seller lets you size the top and bottom. Good seller that makes quality swimwear, I highly recommend!"
6934,The bikini is absolutely gorgeous! Perfect fit and amazing quality. Love it! Thank you so much xxx
6935,"Another awesome item, like with the swimsuit this is a very flattering style and fit. Hides all of the bits I don't necessarily want to show, whilst also being flattering and stylish. I like the retro fit of it."

6937,"Article parfait en tout point ! Envoi rapide, vendeuse super 
Je recommande chaudement 
UN grand MERCI !"
6938,I love this swimsuit ! So comfy & cute ! 💘
6939,The top is soooo flimsy...with the price I was expecting more than just stretchy fabric with a couple pads over the nipple area. Cute material and concept but not at all functional.
6940,Great. Bikini is just like described. And looks wonderful! Thank you!
6941,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ❤️ 🧡 💛 💚 💙 💜
6942,Beautiful!  Worth every penny...  I can't say enough with GAGA's amazing crochet work- Thank you!

6946,It was exactly what I wanted!!!! Absolutely perfect! I’m 5’8 and 125lbs and I ordered a Medium. Fit exactly how it was suppose to! Sizing was perfect!
6947,I ordered three for my three girls fiends who have birthdays in September back to back and the suits were amazing!!! Excellent quality! Delivered in time. Will definitely use Pretty Robes for other fun suit gifts.
6948,I was provided rush shipping when I said I needed the swimsuit asap and it came sooner than expected! Customer service was great and I would definitely buy again!
6949,This was shipped so fast adn the customer service was great!!
6950,"Didn’t get to wear it yet, but from trying it on... it’s so nice!"
6951,"Item was exactly as described and very fast shipping, thank you!!!"
6952,Loved the color of the swimsuit wore once and the letters peeled and stained all my belongings at the beach and pool. Had to throw away after only wearing for a few hours. Dissapointed ruined a brand new beach bag!
6953,"Just perfect, and looks so sexy! Seller is an absolute doll and goes above and beyond. I needed this for a photoshoot & it arrived just in time. Thank you 💕🌺"
6954,This neon lace bodysuit is gorgeous! Fits perfectly & the color makes a tan really pop. Love it!!
6955,It is well made and very pretty.
6956,"LOOOOOVE!!! It arrived this morning and I immediately tried it on, it fits great and is sooo comfy! It’s now nestled safely in my birth center “go bag” since I plan to wear it in labor. Due in less than a month!!! 😱 thank you for giving me something unique and versatile for my daughter’s birth, and for nursing her at the lake this summer!"
6957,"Fun prints, nice material, pretty comfy as far as a bra goes, fits a little funny and straps could use some tension (I'm very busty) but I'm overall impressed and very excited/relieved to wear this for my labor (water birth)  I Bought 2 of these to wear 1 during and then 1 after labor. Quick shipping. Thank you!"
6958,"Fun prints, nice material, pretty comfy as far as a bra goes, fits a little funny and straps could use some tension (I'm very busty) but I'm overall impressed and very excited/relieved to wear this for my labor (water birth)  I Bought 2 of these to wear 1 during and then 1 after labor. Quick shipping. Thank you!"
6959,"I absolutely love it! I wore it around the house no problems, washed it a couple times. Then I went Swimming in it and the ink bled all over my arm pits. Very disappointed in that, other then that it great, but the main reason I bought it was because i needed a bathing suit top."
6960,"The clothes are so cute and the pattern is very deferent than what I’ve seen around. The fabric is a spandex type of feel(super soft), we did get free face masks with out order but they are very big and very cheaply made. The only thing I’m really disappointed is that it was super expensive for this fabric and the pattern. ( I do understand that people aren’t perfect, and yes I don’t know the whole process into making these...but from all the other sites that sell rave clothing are a lot cheeper and better quality as well.) I am happy with my order but I thought for the price is would be a lot different."
6961,Better than expected!! So cute
6962,Absolutely love this whole outfit 🖤
6963,These fit super well and are a very comfortable material! The reflective portions are exactly what I wanted :) I'm 5'7 and about 150 lbs and medium bottoms fit perfectly
6964,kristen was so awesome to work with! i wanted these bottoms but with a thong cut and she was able to customize them for me. i was also between sizes but sent her my dimensions and she made it to my sizes so it fits PERFECTLY. the fabric is not very stretchy so make sure you measure yourself and get the right size!
6965,Absolutely LOVE all the pieces I got! They shipped so fast and look even better in person!!
6966,"This is the cutest and most flattering swimsuit! Using it as a bodysuit for a music festival, definitely unique and the high neck makes it comfortable to wear!"
6967,"I was a little worried as this was my first time buying on Etsy.  THIS BATHING SUIT IS AMAZING!!!  Custom made to your measurements, and very original pieces that no one else will have.  Buy her stuff I promise it’s great"
6968,Beautiful pieces. My first time buying and I love it!
6969,Beautiful
6970,Great outfit! Rhinestones are high quality and do not come off! I will be ordering more suits in the future!
6971,Love it & will definitely order again!
6972,So beautiful! Shipped quickly and is very well made!
6973,Arrived in great condition.  Quick delivery for overseas.  Beautiful visor for the beach!
6974,"I was having issues with the fit of my hat and reached out to Kim to let her know. She provided me with suggestions on how to remedy and in the end, she resolved the issue :)

The hat is super cute and perfect for a beach day. I'm able to put my hair up and off my neck, yet still get the face shade needed. You can comfortably sit back in a beach chair without the brim of your hat getting in the way. Love it! Would recommend!"
6975,Schöner und bequemer Strandhut. Sehr hohe Qualität gemacht. Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Kauf! Die Lieferung erfolgt sehr schnell. Vielen Dank an den Verkäufer!
6976,Exactly what I expected. Nice sturdy brim. True to color. Stretchy band so it fits snugly but not too tight
6977,"Love this visor - really adorable and good quality - just wish it was adjustable. It’s a bit tight on my head which can start to hurt a bit, but hopefully I’ll be able to stretch it out with some wear and then it’ll be perfect. Always getting compliments on it! Love it!"
6978,Amazing quality and satisfactory comfort! Wore it for the first time over the weekend and it exceeded my expectations. Super fast delivery as well! Must buy.
6979,Cute hat!!! It came quickly and has been a great beach hat
6980,Great purchase!! Brim is long so it keeps me shaded from the sun. I get compliments all the time too :)

6983,Love it!! Exactly as pictured. Good quality. Super cute! This visor is going to be perfect for my destination wedding!!
6984,Kim is fantastic and lovely to deal with! Great visit for summer and vacation! Allows for my blonde hair to get blonder and packs well!! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
6985,Well made but too tight for my head. Passed it along. But the straw part is real for those of you hunting for that as I was.

6993,"Just as pictured, very beachy."
6994,Love this visor! And it arrived faster than expected. Great price too.
6995,I love this visor. It is slightly too long (reference is a normal baseball cap brim) but it does a good job keeping the sun out. I have a small head and it fits great since there is elastic in the back
6996,"Hat is beautiful, looks just like the picture and fits great! Can't wait to use!"
6997,It's my hat of summer 2020! Love it so much!

7029,"AAA+++ Seller! Great Items , in great condition, great communication, fast shipment!! THANK YOU SOO MUCH!!!"
7030,flattering.... well made.... love it!***
7031,very cool! lovely different from just the normal tops :)
7032,"Fast shipment, item as described thank you!"
7033,Extremely misleading advertising. I ordered a full suit because that’s what the item is advertised as in the pictures and in the first descriptions of the title. Who the hell spends this much on just a bikini bottom?? Now summer will be over soon and I have no dream bikini. And in the middle of this horrible quarantine summer.
7034,"Received my longyi in all black and I really like it, summer is around the corner and this is the most relaxing item I own in my closet currently. Will definitely be buying more in the near future, thank you!"
7035,Thank you.
7036,Arrived quicker than expected. The longyi has kind of a rugged look which I especially like.
7037,Very nice quality Longyi. Thank you!
7038,"FLAWLESS! Beautiful, comfortable & flattering. Thank you"
7039,Beautiful garment- quick shipping .
7040,"Wonderful swimsuit!! I've always had problems finding a one piece swimsuit that would fit and not make me look funny, this one looks perfect on me! the cut is great, it definitely makes an imperfect figure look to its advantage, I'm not even mentioning the art - very unique and the color palette makes the skin look very fresh! Great communication from the seller too! Highly highly recommend!"
7041,"I bought the Alice in Wonderland themed one piece and the graphics are vibrant and beautiful. It fits well and dries fast. Haven’t had the chance to really wear it yet, but can’t wait. I would recommend this shop to others."
7042,This suit is 🔥🔥🔥
7043,So cute! Love the pattern. Runs a bit small.
7044,It's my second purchase in Badinka shop... Always great! The fabric is fantastic... I'm very very satisfied!!
7045,"love it, it does flatten the chest quite a bit but thats to be expected with this kind of cut"
7046,"Disappointed by the quality of the printing (I suppose the image wasn't big enough? don't know), but the painting is still lovely..."
7047,"This seller was great to work with and even included making the piece in a custom fabric for me at no extra cost. These bottoms are very well made and they fit great - if you pay attention to the size chart (and are honest with yourself about how many inches around you are, haha!) the fit should be no problem! They make my legs look a mile long and I can’t wait to wear them to my pole fitness classes!"
7048,"Aw yeah - I'm a bigger/mid size gal (5'8"", 185 lbs, size 10-12) with a very generous butt and I feel pretty good in this little number. Saving it to wear whenever my fiance and I can go on a beach vacation again!"
7049,"Absolutely perfect. Great fabric quality, suuuuper fast shipping. And the high waist thong bottoms make my bum look great. Ordering more!! My new bikini shop. Done and done."
7050,The fabric and shape are really nice
7051,Gorgeous bathing suit and incredibly warm and personal customer service! Felt like a bathing beauty in my sequin suit at my 50th bday pool party. Thank you!!!
7052,Love this suit! I wore it for my bachelorette and it was a hit.
7053,"It's perfect in every way a swimsuit can be perfect! Now, I need one in ever color! 😂😘"
7054,beautiful and fits perfectly - got here way before the estimated time and I can’t wait to wear it c:
7055,Perfect for my trip to the Grand Caymans!!!
7056,These swim trunks are more than we expected... material is exceptional & size is on point... will definitely order another pair you can’t go wrong with these trunks and long to the knee is an extra plus for my man
7057,Bought as a birthday present and we're both so happy with them. The detail looks even better in person.
7058,"My boyfriend likes it alot, perfect size. It looks great. Thank you"
7059,"The swim shorts are great quality.  Print is awesome, my husband is happy.  Shop owner addresses questions/concerns with no issues.  Will definitely be ordering again from this shop."
7060,"It is a wonderful crochetet Top and fits very well! I ordered with the padding and ist very comfy. I can really recommend this!
The shipping and packing was also excellent!
Thank you again!"
7061,Top bikini è molto bello
7062,"Stunning! I can´t believe it´s handmade 

This won´t be the last item i buy here :-)"
7063,A beautiful bikinitop for next summer!
7064,Super cute but the padding is so thick and stiff it doesn't make sense. I cut it out.
7065,Highly recommend ordering from Indianavogue!!! The quality of these sarongs is so good and the shipping was faster than expected. They also respond to messages very quickly and are happy to help with any questions. Will definitely be ordering from them again!!!!
7066,Lovely lightweight cotton sarongs.  Excellent quality. Charming prints.  Perfect for the beach or around the pool.  Indianavogue provides excellent customer service and speedy delivery.
7067,I have placed many orders with Iniandavogue and each time has been an exceptional experience! Highly recommend!
7068,Amazing! Shipped incredibly fast. Beautiful sarongs.
7069,LOVE these!  Mine came in 5 pairs of colorways....great for the beach and for poolside!  Shipped incredibly quick and arrived as described!  Thank you!
7070,Gorgeous and great quality. Thanks
7071,The pareo's are made so well and love the assortment of colors!
7072,Will definitely be ordering from them again! Great customer support!
7073,Fast shipping and high quality!
7074,"The sarongs are pretty but what I saw in the picture was different than what was shipped. I chose sarongs from the ones that had the colors I liked. What was sent was different colors. I wanted the pink and blues and greens as in the picture.  What was sent was yellow, orange, red etc. not what I ordered. Buyer beware you may not get the colors as represented in the pictures. The ones that came were pretty but not the colors I wanted. They came in a timely way but the colors are wrong. Disappointed."
7075,Product is beautiful and I love it! Fits perfectly and has enough room to move around in. I’m around a large😍 I did have some shipping issues. Not the sellers fault at all. ❤️Usps kept giving me a different tracking number and said it was out for delivery on days it wasn’t. Thank you for the outfit and I will definitely buy from here again.
7076,It’s lit fits perfect definitely shop ‼️‼️😘
7077,"She was so nice, I put in the wrong shipping address due to my dyslexia & she was willing to ship it again if need be, this item was very well made, feels like money as soon as I put it on! 😁🤩"
7078,Great material
7079,I can’t say enough amazing things! These bottoms are absolutely amazing!! They fit so well and I’m utterly obsessed!! I will be ordering more! The seller also answered every single question I had and was exceptional!
7080,I love these bottoms and the material is so nice! These are my favorite go to bottoms ❤️❤️❤️
7081,Absolutely LOVE this bikini! It’s perfect for posing practice!  And the color is beautiful!
7082,Came just as expected & some! I love the color and fit so much!! :)
7083,Great quality and shipped out in timely manner. Size is true to what was listed on the item post. Excited to do my weekly check ins and posing practice in this super fun bold blue color!
7084,"Product is exactly as described. Considering this suit was made upon order, it came relatively quickly."
7085,Great suit and fast shipping!
7086,The bikini is very well made but the cut was not a procut like requested. Communication in the beginning was very quick. But unfortunately I was told I would have the bikini by a certain date and I didn't. Very disappointing.
7087,Package never received.  Per tracking number it’s still waiting in origin facility in “tracking created” status since feb 8.  Owner offered to send another bikini or refund for order. I opted for another order to be sent.  Still waiting 4 days later for new tracking number. Sent follow up message 2 days ago. I hope for a response soon.  Maybe I’ll get the order by March.
7088,"I placed order on 1/26. As of 2/2, package was listed as “pre-shipment”. Seller never messaged that shipment would be delayed due to unforeseen circumstances. Seller only made contact after I messaged her on 2/2. 
Will not do business with this seller again. Poor communication! I did receive a prompt refund though after I asked for it."
7089,Have not recived yet??????? what is going on. Cant track package.
7090,I love this bathing suit! The only two things I'd change would be the thinness of the top and the top ties being so bulky. It's quality though and looks just like the picture!
7091,ONE OF THE MOST COMFORATBLE YET SEXY SUITS I HAVE EVER WORN. The quality of the suit is unbelievable and the braided strings on the bottoms and top add such a great touch of uniqueness and fun!!! CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS SUIT!!!
7092,Awesome!! Thank you so much!
7093,Quality product and cute as a button! This was a great purchase; would recommend to anyone looking for a flattering retro swimsuit!
7094,I love the shape and how protective it is with my breasts.
7095,"Super cute, well made, and just perfect!!"
7096,Amazing bathing suit! Good quality and at a wonderful price.
7097,"The swimsuit is perfect! I could’ve maybe gone for a small but the medium fits comfortably. I messaged the seller before purchasing because I wanted to be sure I would get it before my bachelorette trip to Miami, she replied right away and assured me I would get it in time and I did! I’m very satisfied and definitely recommend her shop!"
7098,So quick to receive and fits perfect! cannot wait to wear for my bachelorette party!
7099,The top came in a bit too big but the bottoms fit fantastic! Seller is fabulous and working with me to get the right size top.
7100,Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous really love this was a bit worried about the top because it looked like it might be a bit small but it wasn’t it’s really nice..roll on Bahamas ☀️🏖✈️💜☀️
7101,"The rainbow bikini is absolutely adorable. Well made, great quality."
7102,"Love the suit itself, did not ship on time as listed on site."
